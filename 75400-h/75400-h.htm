<small>ON THE WAY TO THE GAME</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Give</span> it again, fellows! For the honor of old
Columbia—now, once more, with a will!” shouted
the cheer captain, Herman Hooker.</p>

<p>“Ho! ho! ho! hi! hi! hi! <i>veni, vidi, vici!</i> Columbia!”</p>

<p>“Cast off there, somebody.”</p>

<p>“Start your engine, Frank, old boy!”</p>

<p>“Hurrah! we’re afloat on the raging Harrapin at
last!”</p>

<p>“Got any life preservers aboard, fellows?”</p>

<p>Amid all this uproar and confusion Frank Allen,
cool and collected, gave a whirl to the crank to turn
his engine over; and immediately a succession of
rattling reports testified to the fact that as master
of ceremonies he had given the expedition a good
send-off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>Then he handed over the engine to the charge of
Abner Gould, the man employed regularly by Commodore
Adams, to whom the launch belonged.</p>

<p>The <i>Geraldine</i> had been loaned to the members of
the Columbia High School baseball team for this special
occasion, by the owner, just then away on business.</p>

<p>Accompanied by several members of the Columbia
band, they were now on their way down the Harrapin
river, to play their first game with the Bellport
High School nine, and enthusiasm waxed furious
over the prospect ahead.</p>

<p>A peculiar condition of the weather had sadly
disarranged the schedule of the Harrapin River
League. Three clubs composed the organization,
representing Bellport, Clifford and Columbia; and it
had been agreed that each was to play a trio of
games with both opposing teams. The one who came
out ahead would, of course, be given the pennant,
and hailed as the champion for the year, an honor
greatly coveted, since the three towns were keen
rivals in all athletic matters.</p>

<p>While Columbia and Bellport had each played
three games thus far, they had all been with the
third member of the league, Clifford.</p>

<p>What seemed still more singular was the fact that
in each of these series Clifford had won one game
and lost two. Consequently, Columbia and Bellport<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
were now <i>tied for first place</i>, with three games
to be played, while Clifford was out of the race completely.</p>

<p>To-day was to see the first game between these
two giants. And the choice of ground had fallen
upon Bellport.</p>

<p>As this enterprising town lay quite a number of
miles down the river, it had been suggested that the
Columbia nine journey that way by means of Commodore
Adams’ launch, which, with the services of
his man, had been gladly offered for the day.</p>

<p>Of course the two towns were connected by a
trolley, owned principally by the father of Lef Seller,
a junior in the school, and just now in bad odor
on account of some pranks he had played a short
time before. Special cars had been brought into
use on this gala day to accommodate the crowds
desiring to witness the struggle that must accompany
the first meeting of the rival nines.</p>

<p>With the flags of the Harrapin River Boat Club
floating from stem and stern, and the band tooting
away gaily, the little launch left the float, and started
merrily down-stream.</p>

<p>A roar from the crowd on the bank testified to
the fact that, while all Columbia could not journey
over to Bellport to witness this impending game, the
sympathies of those compelled to remain at home<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
were with the boys who represented the honor of
the High School on this occasion.</p>

<p>“Say, this is what I call going to battle in style,”
said Lanky Wallace, the tall first baseman, as he
shoved alongside Frank on the crowded seat, and
threw an arm around the other with the air of a
chum.</p>

<p>“I was just speculating on how we will return—with
shouts and cheers, or dolefully telling each other
just how it happened,” remarked Frank; but his smiling
face was evidence of the fact that he had little
fears on that score as he looked around at the enthusiastic
countenances of his comrades.</p>

<p>“If your arm’s in prime condition, as you say, I’m
not worrying any on that score, Frank. Coddling
may be a wonder, just as they claim, but once we
get on to his curves there’s going to be some smashing
work done. I feel that I’m in for business at
the old stand myself, to-day,” returned Lanky, with
a positive shake of his head.</p>

<p>“Glad to hear you say it. A pitcher needs confidence
in the ability of his men to get runs, as well
as field like a machine. We’ve just <i>got</i> to do that
crowd up to-day, and that’s all there is to it.”</p>

<p>“And we will, never fear, Frank,” observed Roderic
Seymour, who, leading senior though he was,
considered it an honor to serve as captain, and play<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
second with the snappy nine Columbia had put into
the field this year.</p>

<p>“Are we on time?” demanded Buster Billings,
always afraid of getting left, although worrying
did not seem to reduce his abundant flesh so that it
could be noticed.</p>

<p>“Yes, with a margin to spare, if the boat shoves
along as she is doing right now,” replied Lanky
Wallace.</p>

<p>Lanky, of course, covered first, and few balls ever
passed through his territory when he was feeling fit.</p>

<p>Lef Seller was aboard the boat, since he was a
member of the team, though under a cloud temporarily,
and forbidden by the faculty from taking
part in any baseball game during the season. This
severe punishment sprung from his action in playing
an unusually mean prank upon Frank, whom he
chose to regard as his mortal enemy; and which circumstance,
together with many other interesting
events, has been set forth in full in the preceding
volume of this series, called: “The Boys of Columbia
High; or, The All Around Rivals of the School.”</p>

<p>Lef tried to join with his mates and appear jolly,
but it was a great effort, when his heart was sore
on account of being listed as the black sheep of the
flock, to be shunned by self-respecting fellows.</p>

<p>He had his own followers, who toadied to him
on account of the money he spent so freely; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
none of them happened to be aboard the boat, so
Lef felt that he was in one sense out of his element.</p>

<p>The beautiful home town faded out of sight up
the river, and all eyes began to be turned toward
the bow, as they anticipated catching a distant
glimpse of Bellport at any moment.</p>

<p>“Better save your wind until later, Herman!”
called out Tom Budd, the lithe shortstop, and a fellow
who was a natural acrobat, doing stunts in and
out of season; so that no one was ever surprised to
see him spring into the air, catch a liner, turn completely
over, and come up smiling, with the ball held
up for the umpire to take notice.</p>

<p>“Plenty more left,” laughed the “best yeller Columbia
ever had,” as he waved his megaphone in
the air, and led the boys in another song.</p>

<p>It was a glorious day in June, and not one aboard
that boat but felt the inspiration of the magical
sunshine and soft air.</p>

<p>Half of the distance separating the rival towns
had been covered by this time, and the gallant little
launch was making fine speed down the current.</p>

<p>“Looks like Clifford meant to be represented at
the game, too,” remarked one of the boys, pointing
to the shore.</p>

<p>Clifford was above Columbia, and on the other
bank of the river. A road led down to the vicinity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
of Bellport, where a ferry took farm wagons across.
And on this road a cloud of dust told that all sorts
of vehicles had been impressed into service to carry
the baseball-mad people to the scene.</p>

<p>Fine cars shot along, blowing their horns, and
steady-going farm horses trotted evenly by the side
of the road, all heading in the one direction. It was
enough to thrill the boys belonging to the team to
realize that all this excitement in the county was
caused by their crossing bats with the Bellport High
nine.</p>

<p>“Poor old Clifford never got a peep in this year,”
mocked Jack Comfort, said to be the best chaser after
flies the school had ever known, and who guarded
center field.</p>

<p>“Well, they had hard luck. The game they won
from us showed that there was cracking good stuff
on the team. I never saw a better game in my life,
with the score tied in the ninth. Wow! that was
some exciting!” exclaimed Lanky, his eyes sparkling
at the recollection.</p>

<p>“It would have been our game if Ben Allison
could have held that fly out in left. He made a big
effort, but dropped the ball,” remarked Captain Seymour,
sadly.</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon that failure just knocked poor
Ben out. He’s been no good to the team ever since,
and here we have to put our extra pitcher in right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
garden just to fill in, because he’s a crackerjack pinch
hitter!” grumbled Buster.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, boys, and I’m only too glad of
the chance to play at all. A freshman doesn’t often
get on the team, and it’s mighty fine for you to
boost me up this way,” Ralph West hastened to remark.</p>

<p>Ralph did not live in Columbia, being one of the
pay students. He was anxious for an education,
and a fortunate chance had allowed him to come to
the thriving river town at the beginning of the
school year. He and Frank had become good
friends, and the latter was deeply interested in certain
strange features connected with Ralph’s fortunes.</p>

<p>“I think it’s a poor rule that keeps freshmen off
the team so much. They are better fitted to take
part in sports then than later on, when filled with
ambition to excel in their studies,” said Jack Eastwick,
one of the juniors, and a substitute on the
team.</p>

<p>At this there was a universal howl, for Jack was
notoriously averse to studying under any and all circumstances,
and depended upon a system of “cramming”
just before examinations to carry him
through.</p>

<p>“Now, there’s a wide difference of opinion on
that question. For my part, I fully agree with
Coach Willoughby, who says——” but Buster was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
seldom allowed to tell what this wonderful instructor,
whom the boys really believed existed only in
the imagination of the fat right fielder, had to say.</p>

<p>As usual, a shout cut him short, and with an injured
stare at the laughing group, he relapsed into
disdainful silence.</p>

<p>“Where are their grounds located?” asked Ralph,
who had never as yet had an opportunity for visiting
the Bellport field.</p>

<p>“Half a mile below the town. Bellport is something
of a manufacturing place, and there’s going to
be more or less of a rough element at the game, for
the factories have shut down for a half holiday, beginning
this Saturday, and the hands are sure to
be out in force.”</p>

<p>Frank looked a trifle anxious as he spoke, for
truth to tell he had more than once wondered
whether a sense of fairness would animate that
rough element, or the desire to see Bellport win at
any cost.</p>

<p>“Listen! I thought I heard a roar just then. The
wind is coming up the river, and it must have been
shouts from the ball field,” and Seymour held up his
hand to ask for silence.</p>

<p>It was while they were thus straining their ears
to catch the sounds from below that all at once the
familiar “pop-pop” of the exhaust connected with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
the motor boat ceased, and soon their rapid progress
fell off.</p>

<p>Immediately everybody started to shout at once,
wanting to know what had gone wrong. Frank
sprang over to where Abner Gould bent over the
little motor. The man lifted a troubled face toward
him.</p>

<p>Every eye was glued on Frank as he started to
examine the engine, for they knew he had more of
a practical knowledge of such things than any one
aboard, unless it might be the man hired by Commodore
Adams to run his launch.</p>

<p>“What ails the thing, Frank?” demanded Buster,
as the other raised up.</p>

<p>“Yes, this isn’t the time for playing pranks. We’re
nearly due now on the field, and don’t want to be
called shirks!” exclaimed Lanky, warmly.</p>

<p>“Boys, I’ve got some bad news for you,” announced
Frank.</p>

<p>“What is it? Don’t keep us in suspense, old warhorse!”
cried “Bones” Shadduck, who played third
on the team.</p>

<p>“The motor has broken down, and we’re in a bad
box!” declared Frank, seriously.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A groan</span> went up from full twenty throats, at this
dismal announcement.</p>

<p>“What shall we do? We can’t just float down
like this. It would look as if we were whipped before
we began to play!” sang out Jack Comfort,
almost in a whine.</p>

<p>“We’ve just got to swim for it, that’s all! Me
for the cool drink!” said Lanky, pretending to
poise on the bow of the boat as if for a plunge.</p>

<p>Frank looked serious indeed, but it was something
more than the fact of the breakdown that worried
him. He had reason for suspecting that Abner
Gould must have done something to bring about this
condition of affairs!</p>

<p>Still, he said nothing about it, not being sure. But
he could not help remembering that this man had
a brother who was known as something of a sport,
and made himself conspicuous at many of the baseball
games by his disposition to bet upon the result,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
something that the faculty of the several schools
very much objected to, though unable to stop fully.</p>

<p>Dimly Frank could see how there might be some
connection between this circumstance and their sudden
delay. If Watkins Gould had been wagering
heavily against the Columbia team winning, everything
that helped disconcert them, and make them
unduly anxious, was to his credit. And Abner did
not have a face that Frank thought could be trusted.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, boys,” he said, as the others
crowded around, “there are more ways than one for
getting to Bellport. If necessary we could go ashore
and take the trolley.”</p>

<p>“You might if they let us climb on the roof, for
every car is loaded down with people,” observed
Paul Bird, Frank’s chum and catcher.</p>

<p>“All right. Here comes Mr. Garabrant in his
launch. Possibly he may be glad to give us a tow.”</p>

<p>Frank, as he spoke, kept his eyes on the face of
the man who had charge of the motor. He felt
positive he saw a sudden look of keen disappointment
come upon it, though Abner, upon noticing
that he was being observed, tried to look pleased.</p>

<p>“He did it, I’m dead certain!” was what Frank
was saying to himself, as a thrill of indignation
passed over his frame.</p>

<p>He could stand honest defeat, but when trickery
was brought into play it made him angry. At the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
same time he did not dream for a moment that any
one on the opposing team could have had a hand in
this mess.</p>

<p>Herman Hooker immediately got his megaphone
into service.</p>

<p>“Ahoy there, Mr. Garrabrant! Will you kindly
head this way?” he shouted.</p>

<p>The other launch immediately changed its course
and approached. There was quite a little company
aboard, and evidently the party was headed for the
athletic field of Bellport, to witness the great game.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong here?” asked the gentlemanly
owner, as he stood up, the better to see.</p>

<p>“A breakdown, and we have really no time to
monkey with repairs. Could you give us a tow,
sir?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“Only too glad, boys. It’s very evident that unless
I do there would be small chance for a game to-day.
Hand us a painter, and we’ll make fast to a
cleat at our stern,” replied the Columbia business
man, readily.</p>

<p>This being quickly adjusted, progress was once
more resumed. Perhaps they did not move quite so
fast as before, but that was a matter of small moment.
Once more the cheer captain led in vigorous
shouts that rang over the water, and brought answering
cries from either shore.</p>

<p>“There’s Bellport!” said Frank, directing the attention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
of Ralph to the numerous tall chimneys that
marked the manufacturing town; but they were
belching out no smoke this afternoon, for the plants
lay idle, with the vast majority of the busy workers
in holiday attire heading toward the athletic field.</p>

<p>A landing was made, and jumping ashore, the
boys gathered their material of war, after which the
march was taken up for the scene of battle.</p>

<p>And when they turned a bend in the road, with
the fine field spread before them, every fellow was
thrilled to note the tremendous throng that had
gathered to see the game, and shout for their respective
team.</p>

<p>“Whew! where did they all come from?” gasped
Lanky, as he gaped at the host of waving handkerchiefs
and hats that greeted their arrival.</p>

<p>“The whole country is baseball mad, that’s what,”
remarked Paul, as he strode along at the side of the
pitcher.</p>

<p>“It’s a grand sight, and ought to spur every fellow
to doing his level best,” remarked the other, drawing
in a big breath, for he had never before known such
a gathering to greet the Columbia High team, at
home or abroad.</p>

<p>As usual, some of the boys began to pass balls
as they moved across the diamond. This was done
to wear away any nervousness that the sight of the
immense crowd might have aroused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>The Bellport team had been practicing for some
time now, and were ready to give up the diamond
to the visitors. As the time for the commencement
of the game was not far away, Captain Seymour
sent his men out, and started Frank to warming up.</p>

<p>The grandstand fairly swarmed with people, and
the bleachers were packed. Indeed, ropes had to
be used to keep the crowd off the diamond, and hundreds
sat beyond the right field, where there happened
to be some shade.</p>

<p>It sounded like Bedlam broke loose, what with
the various school yells, the cat-calls and shouts,
and now and then a song breaking above the clamor.
Herman Hooker had hurried over to where his
shouting clan awaited him. They had kept a seat
for him in the front row, where he could jump up
at the proper time, and lead the cheering with that
astounding foghorn voice of his.</p>

<p>Frank noticed as he passed the ball in to Paul that
Watkins Gould was present, and apparently boldly
seeking bets on the game. The bleachers were occupied
for the most part with the factory workers, a
rough crowd, and many of them ready to take a
chance on their favorite team.</p>

<p>When finally the Columbia boys came in after a
strenuous practice covering about a quarter of an
hour, the many-colored flags fluttered from the hands
of those in the grandstand until the structure looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
like a great bunch of flowers; while from hundreds
of lusty throats rose the various class and school
cries, blending in a surge of sound.</p>

<p>Then Bellport took the field, their going out being
the signal for a tremendous ovation, for they had
the full support of their town.</p>

<p>Roderic Seymour had changed the batting list
somewhat since the last game played with Clifford.
To Ralph was given the honor of leading off, since
he was playing in place of Ben Allison. The order
ran in this fashion:</p>

<div class="indentleft">
<p>Ralph West—Left field.<br>
“Bones” Shaddock—Third base.<br>
Jack Comfort—Center field.<br>
Lanky Wallace—First base.<br>
Buster Billings—Right field.<br>
Tom Budd—Shortstop.<br>
Roderic Seymour—Second base.<br>
Paul Bird—Catcher.<br>
Frank Allen—Pitcher.</p>
</div>
<p>Ralph was a fair batter, but a better waiter. For
this latter reason he had been given orders to take his
time, and as he faced the opposing pitcher, Coddling,
who was said to be the best twirler Bellport had ever
turned out, he assumed a position of eagerness and
expectancy, as though burning with anxiety to strike.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>Coddling had never played against any of these
fellows before. He was therefore forced to depend
entirely on what his catcher signaled. And Clay,
while on the team the preceding year, knew nothing
about the weaknesses of this new batter.</p>

<p>Consequently Ralph got his base, after two strikes
had been called on him, one of which was really a
miss at an outcurve.</p>

<p>Of course the excitement began at once. A hum
went around the field, and Columbia stock arose,
with mocking cries hurled at the local adherents.</p>

<p>Shaddock was a good hitter as rule. He had
made something of a record on the team the preceding
year. The best he could do now, after knocking
three fouls, was to send one into the hands of
the shortstop, who failed, however, to double Ralph
at second on account of a fumble.</p>

<p>Intense interest was taken in the coming to bat
of Jack Comfort.</p>

<p>“Lace one out, old boy!” howled the Columbia
bunch in the center of the bleachers, where they had
gathered to fairly split the atmosphere with their
shouts.</p>

<p>“You can do it if you try! Over Lacy’s head,
Jack!”</p>

<p>Jack thereupon did try. Three times he swung
on the ball, and as often it came with a dull, sickening
thud in the catcher’s big mitt, while the grin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
on the face of Smith, Sr., the tall first baseman,
was most exasperating.</p>

<p>A roar went up as Jack walked back to the bench
shaking his head. Those elusive “spit” balls of
Coddling had him guessing, and silently he stared
at the slim pitcher who had proved his right to the
name of wizard, as if trying to fathom where his
own efforts fell short.</p>

<p>Now came Lanky Wallace. He was warmly
greeted by friend and foe alike, for somehow everybody
knew the elongated Columbia first baseman
always did his level best, and played a clean, square
game.</p>

<p>Lanky was more fortunate than Jack, for he hit
the second ball Coddling floated up, hit it with a
vim that sent the sphere whistling out toward left,
much to the surprise of the pitcher, and the delight
of the crowd.</p>

<p>As a man the entire mass swung to their feet to
follow the course of the ball. Smith, Jr., so called
to distinguish him from his brother, was covering
ground at a great rate, in the hope of getting his
hands upon the flying horsehide ere it went past.</p>

<p>“He’s got it!” whooped the Bellport enthusiasts,
as the left fielder made a fine leap in the air, and
apparently snatched the ball down.</p>

<p>“Not much he has! Go it, both of you! He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
knocked the ball down, but never held it! Run,
you lazybones. Make a homer of it, Lanky!”</p>

<p>It seemed as though two thousand people were
madly shrieking as the runners sped around the
bases. Smith, Jr., had recovered the ball, and was
relaying it home in the effort to catch Ralph at the
plate. A great slide, however, allowed the Columbia
man to get his run. Meanwhile, Lanky had reached
third, and was held on that bag by the coach.</p>

<p>With two out and a man on third Buster Billings
swung his bat as if ready to put the ball over the
head of Snodgrass in right field.</p>

<p>“Give me an easy one, Mr. Pitcher. I’m only
learning how to swing on ’em. Coach Willoughby
says——” and then Buster hit it!</p>

<p>The ball took an awkward turn, so that although
both the pitcher and second baseman made a dive
at it neither was fortunate enough to fork the elusive
sphere. Amid a frightful clamor the fat Columbia
student managed to get to first, where he presently
stood, wiping his red face with a bandana.</p>

<p>Of course Lanky easily came in, and the score
had been raised to two, which was an encouraging
start for the visitors, considering who was doing
the pitching.</p>

<p>Tom Budd proved an easy victim, however. Coddling
took a brace, and although the Columbia shortstop
certainly tried his best to connect with one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
the bewildering drops which were handed up to
him, he never touched the ball.</p>

<p>So the inning ended for Columbia, and they took
the field. Confidence had, however, been installed
in their hearts, for it seemed as if the terrible Coddling
might after all not be so very hard to get at.</p>

<p>Frank had been up against most of these fellows
before. He knew that they had a reputation as
heavy hitters, and once started were hard to stop.</p>

<p>Snodgrass, the first man up, usually managed to
draw his base. His very attitude at the plate bothered
a pitcher, which was just what he meant it to do.</p>

<p>But Frank was determined that he should strike,
and sent swift balls directly over until he had managed
to get the other just where he wanted him.
Then a well directed outcurve deceived Snodgrass.
He went back to the bench amid the groans of the
crowd.</p>

<p>Then up rose Hough, the doughty second baseman,
who was playing in place of Captain Cuthbert
Lee, on the sick list, with his trusty bat. He knocked
imaginary dirt from the soles of his shoes and took
his place. Hough had a good batting eye, and could
pick one out all right.</p>

<p>Two balls and one strike had been called when
he swung viciously. The sound of the connection
was like a rifle report, and instantaneously the immense
crowd gave a howl of delight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>Again was there an upheaval, as every eye tried
to follow the flight of the rapidly shooting ball.</p>

<p>It was headed for the territory of Buster, and the
fat fielder was straining every nerve to get within
reaching distance of the flying sphere!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>A GAME WORTH SEEING</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">See</span> the ice wagon move!”</p>

<p>“It’s got an engine attached to it somewhere, fellows!”</p>

<p>“Will he get it—maybe, maybe not!” whooped
Jack Eastwick.</p>

<p>“It’s a balloon, that’s what it is!” howled one Bellport
enthusiast.</p>

<p>They saw Buster glancing over his shoulder once
or twice as he ran. It was a perfect wonder that
he did not stumble and fall flat, for on more than
one former occasion that was what had happened to
the apparently clumsy fielder.</p>

<p>But Frank had high hopes. He knew that Buster
could rise to an emergency, and really accomplish
the impossible—for such stockily built fellows of his
class. He held his breath as the fielder turned
squarely around and threw up one of his hands.
Hough was already shooting down toward second
in wild haste. If Buster made a mess of it the hit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
was likely to count a home run, for it had enough
steam behind it to carry far afield.</p>

<p>“He did it, Buster did it!” cried dozens of voices,
as though the speakers had considerable difficulty
in believing their own eyes.</p>

<p>Then a fierce wave of sound went surging over
the field. It was a fine play that appealed to the
sportsmanlike spirit of an American crowd, so that
even the warmest adherents of Bellport High joined
in the tremendous cheer that awoke the echoes in
the hills near by.</p>

<p>And Hough walked in from second, shaking his
head, and looking back toward the plump fielder as
though he felt that he had been robbed.</p>

<p>Two out! It was a splendid beginning, and
nerved Frank to keep up the good work. If the
balance of the boys only did their duty as Buster
had shown how, the game would turn out to be a
one-sided affair at best.</p>

<p>But Frank knew the vagaries that attach to baseball,
which serve to give it its greatest charm. No
game is won until the last man is put out. A rally
can cause a winning team to go all to pieces, so that
their opponents fairly “shoot holes through their
ranks.”</p>

<p>“Banghardt next!”</p>

<p>“He’s the boy who can do it, else why his name?”</p>

<p>“Watch him knock the cover off the ball! See<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
the fielders move out. Oh! Allen knows this chap.
He’s the swift bunch, all right!”</p>

<p>After all this boasting it must have been a bit
humiliating to the Bellport boosters to see their
idol strike out; but that was what the mighty Banghardt
did. Three separate times did he send that
wagon-tongue bat of his whistling through the air,
each occasion being marked with a distinct grunt
as it met only vacant space, for the ball was not
where he believed it to be.</p>

<p>“Better luck next time, Tony! Taking his measure
are you?” yelled a Columbia boy, derisively, as
the fielder threw his bat savagely away, and started
out to attend to his territory, for the inning was
over.</p>

<p>Coddling took a brace after that first unfortunate
affair, and the next three visitors who faced him
were mowed down in regular order. His curves
were most exasperating, his speed terrific, and he
could mix a few fadeaway balls with the others in
a fashion that kept the batter guessing all the time.</p>

<p>So once more Frank went into the box to face
the hard-hitting Bellport men.</p>

<p>“Promises to be a warm game,” remarked a man
who happened to be sitting beside Lef Seller on the
bleachers.</p>

<p>“Oh! I don’t know,” replied the disgruntled Columbia
student, a pitcher of no mean merit himself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
and who, but for his own misconduct, might have
been serving on the team as a substitute. “That
Coddling is a marvel sure, and they say he gets
better right along, finishing strong. It’s different,
with Frank. You see he starts well, but any little
thing is apt to rattle him badly, so that he goes to
pieces.”</p>

<p>This was not so, as Lef well knew, but he could
never resist the temptation to give the boy he hated
a sly and underhand dig.</p>

<p>The gentleman looked at his hat-band curiously.</p>

<p>“You’re from Columbia, too, I believe, judging
from the purple and gold ribbon you wear?” he remarked,
with a slight sneer.</p>

<p>“Oh! yes, I used to pitch for them last year, but
the faculty jumped on me for some foolish little
thing I did, and refused to let me take part this
season. Frank does his best, we all know, but he
isn’t just as steady as he might be,” continued Lef,
brazenly.</p>

<p>“That’s queer. I had an idea Frank was about
as cool a player as I had ever seen in my old days
at Princeton. If that’s the reputation he has then
I’ve made the poorest play of my life, and I used
to be considered a judge. Buster gave me to understand
differently.”</p>

<p>“Then you know Buster Billings?” asked Lef,
quickly and uneasily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>“Why, I’m stopping at his house just now,” came
the reply.</p>

<p>“Oh! then I can understand how it comes you
think so highly of Frank, because he has a few
chums always ready to sneeze when he takes snuff.
There are some others in Columbia, and I own that
I’m one of the gang, who believe Frank Allen to be
a greatly overrated athlete. There! did you see him
pass that man. He never pitched near the plate. I
told you he could be easily rattled!”</p>

<p>“Wait, my boy. Many a pitcher, as you know,
does that, when he feels it in his bones that the batter
is able to hit the ball. Besides, perhaps he knows
that the next man is an easy mark for him,” remarked
the gentleman, who seemed to be quite at
home with regard to the fine points of the game.</p>

<p>“That Smith, Jr., is the left fielder, and I have
seen him send the ball out of sight. But his brother
is no pie either, and if Frank thinks he’s going to
mow him down he has another guess coming,” muttered
Lef, eagerly watching, and ready to howl
should the batter connect.</p>

<p>“One strike!” announced the umpire, though the
man had not swung at all.</p>

<p>With the next ball he did strike viciously, but
the merry plunk as the horsehide sphere settled comfortably
in the big mitt of Paul Bird told that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
had failed to properly gauge the line of its rifleball
flight.</p>

<p>After that came a foul and two balls. Frank
believed he had his measure taken, and it was with
the utmost confidence that he sent in one of his tantalizing
out-curves.</p>

<p>“You’re out!” shouted the umpire.</p>

<p>The man on first had not dared run down, for
he knew Frank’s battery mate was a remarkably
accurate thrower to second; and that only on rare
occasions had any opposing player purloined that
sack while Paul Bird stood behind the plate.</p>

<p>“Only one down!” shouted the coach near first,
dancing about in an effort to divert the pitcher’s
attention from his business; but Frank was up to all
such stale tricks, and paid no attention to Snodgrass,
his eye being on Lacy at the bat, and Smith, Jr., on
the initial sack.</p>

<p>Lacy was reckoned the dude of Bellport High. He
always seemed as though “walking on eggs,” as some
of the Columbia fellows said, and his manner of
dressing in the very latest style had gained him the
name of being a dandy. But when it came to covering
that short field he had few peers among the
school teams in that part of the country.</p>

<p>He could also lace them out on occasion, too, having
that very desirable quality in a successful player,
called a “batting eye.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>Frank knew him of old, and played him cautiously.
In spite of his care, however, Herb reached
out and tapped one of his outshoots. The ball went
plunging in the direction of short, and the crowd
gasped to see how that acrobatic Tom Budd did his
part of the business.</p>

<p>He threw himself headlong at the passing ball, as
though his legs were unable to carry him fast enough.
They saw him turn a complete somersault and land
on his feet like an acrobat in the circus.</p>

<p>“Wow!” howled the amazed Bellport players, as
Tom whirled and sent the ball to Seymour on second,
who instantly relayed it to Lanky just in time to
cut off the leaping Lacy while he was yet in the air.</p>

<p>“A double! What do you think of that for playing?”
shrieked the Columbia crowd, standing on
their feet, and waving the colors of their school as
if frenzied.</p>

<p>“What sort of a human hinge have you got out
there in short?” asked the gentleman alongside Lef;
“I’ve seen some clever plays in my time, but that
certainly beat them all out. Can that chap play baseball
standing on his head?”</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s Tom Budd, and he’s always doing
stunts. Sometimes he succeeds, but more often
makes a muss of it,” grunted Lef, who had felt disgusted
to see Bellport mowed down so easily when
things looked bright for a run.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>“I’m glad I happened to see him when he succeeded,
then. That was worth ten times the price
of the admission. I came to see a baseball match,
but this is as good as a circus,” laughed the other.</p>

<p>Lef moved away. Somehow or other he felt that
he would be in more congenial atmosphere among
some of the Bellport rooters, and listening to derogatory
remarks concerning the fellow he detested.</p>

<p>It was Ralph at the bat again, and this time he
went out on a fly that Snodgrass captured after a
hard run. Shadduck fanned after knocking about
seven fouls that gave Clay a number of hard runs
without any success at corraling one. And while
Jack Comfort managed to lift one that landed him
on first, he perished on the way to second, owing to
Clay’s straight shoot to the bag.</p>

<p>In their half of the third, Bellport managed to put
one run over. Shaddock fumbled a hot liner that
came his way, allowing the stout Bardwell to gallop
to first. Then Clay lifted a fly that, while caught,
gave the other a chance to land on second.</p>

<p>“Play the game, fellows!” shouted the eager
watchers, as the pitcher took his place to bat.</p>

<p>Coddling bunted, and while out at first the chance
was given Bardwell to settle himself comfortably
on third.</p>

<p>This compelled Snodgrass to hit, something he
seldom did, preferring to get his base on balls.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
With a lucky little pop fly that neither Lanky nor
Buster could reach before it fell, he brought his
man in.</p>

<p>Hough went out on a long fly to Comfort, so
that the score was now two to one in favor of Columbia.</p>

<p>Frank, when coming in, glanced up toward the
grandstand. He knew very well just where his sister
and Minnie Cuthbert were seated, and nodded
his head with a smile in answer to the furious waving
of the little purple and gold banners both girls carried.
It was an inspiration to him to know that
they were watching his work.</p>

<p>Then he looked up at the beautiful pennant that
floated over the field, offered by the same Mr. Garabrant
who had towed their disabled launch, to the
club winning the greater number of games in this
tri-school league series of battles on the diamond.</p>

<p>“You’ll get it, Frank, never fear!” shouted some
one from the bleachers, seeing that look he gave.</p>

<p>“Don’t count your chickens before they’re
hatched,” jeered a Bellport rooter.</p>

<p>“It’s a bully good fight, all right,” admitted a
Clifford man, “and we’re only sorry to be out of it
up our way. But most of our people want Columbia
to win.”</p>

<p>Three more innings saw no change in the score.
Several hits were made off each pitcher, but good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
fielding, and a tightening up all around, prevented
any damage resulting from such isolated cases.</p>

<p>So the seventh commenced, with the strain greater
than ever.</p>

<p>“Hold them down, Frank! You’ve got it, if you
do!”</p>

<p>“But do some little batting yourselves, boys. Get
at him! Coddling’s easy when you just know how!”
jeered the other side.</p>

<p>When Paul Bird stepped up to the plate to take his
turn at the beginning of the seventh some one started
to sing, “Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean.” A
score of voices instantly joined in, followed by hundreds
of others, until there was so much noise that
the decisions of the umpire could not be heard above
it, and he had to depend on gestures entirely.</p>

<p>And while the uproar was at its height Paul was
sent to first on balls!</p>

<p>“Coddling is getting rattled, boys! Keep it up!”
shrieked a dozen frantic Columbia fellows, waving
their ribbon bedecked hats wildly.</p>

<p>“Watch Frank bring him in with a three-bagger!
He can do it, all right!” sang the crowd, as the
pitcher stepped quietly up to the plate.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>THE RALLY THAT CAME TOO LATE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span> gave no sign of the excitement that thrilled
his every nerve. He realized that possibly a fortunate
hit on his part right then and there would
eventually win the game.</p>

<p>Despite the furious racket that kept up on every
hand, he faced Coddling, and prepared to do his
very best to at least advance the runner.</p>

<p>As a rule pitchers are not reckoned good batters,
but Frank Allen had always been known to hit well.
Coddling therefore tightened up, and determined to
put his rival out of the running by tempting him
with some of his astonishing assortment of curves
and drops, for his swift ball had already cost him
dear, so that he was afraid to use it often.</p>

<p>Frank even allowed a strike to be called on him
before he picked out one that seemed to his liking.
What he did to that ball was a caution. It sailed
away out in right, and Snodgrass had the run of
his life to chase after it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>Paul, reaching second, paused, an instant, for if
the ball were caught, he would have some difficulty
getting back to first in time.</p>

<p>“Go on, Paul!” bellowed the coach through his
hands.</p>

<p>The noise had broken out worse than ever, so that
each player had to be a law unto himself just then.</p>

<p>“He muffed it! Run! run! run!” whooped everybody
who had the interest of Columbia at heart,
while the Bellport adherents looked dismal enough.</p>

<p>It was an excusable error, for the fielder had fallen
headlong at the instant his fingers touched the ball.
He was up like a flash and chasing after it. Paul
circled the bases and easily came home, but the
coach held Frank at third, as the ball was coming
in when he reached there.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it had been a three-bagger, despite
the mess Snodgrass had made of his effort to capture
the fly, and a run had resulted. Frank had reason
to feel satisfied with himself as he crouched there
and panted for breath.</p>

<p>He knew that the chances were he would be a
little off in his work unless this inning lasted for
some time. That was one reason why his fellow
players tried to delay matters as best they could
within reason. Ralph tied his shoe, and then
knocked three fouls, finally going out on one that
Clay managed to get after a furious rush among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
crowd to the right, and which brought him much
hand-clapping.</p>

<p>Then Bones Shadduck tried his hand. He wanted
to bring Frank in, and struck savagely at what he
considered fair balls; but Coddling had him guessing,
and finally put him to sleep with a fadeaway that
had not even reached the plate when the batter tried
to knock it out of sight, and “fell all over himself,”
as Lanky said, while doing so.</p>

<p>In their half of this inning the Bellport boys
seemed to awaken from the trance that had been
binding them. There was a hustle and an energy to
their play that told Frank he had better take care,
or a batting rally would set in under which Bellport
would speed to victory as on former occasions.</p>

<p>Bardwell opened with a hit that bounded off the
shins of Seymour. When the captain and second
baseman of Columbia managed to snatch up the ball
it was too late to head the runner off, though Bardwell
was a clumsy man on bases.</p>

<p>He pretended to limp around as though he had
been spiked or something. The trick is, of course,
as old as the hills. It only happens when a better
runner is wanted on the initial bag. Seymour
nodded his head when the Bellport captain called
out, and accordingly Lacy was substituted for the
elephantine Bardwell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>Clay tried to bring him in with a big hit away
out in center, but Comfort was on his job in that
territory, and managed to corral the ball after backing
out, even though he could not keep Lacy from
taking second.</p>

<p>Then came Coddling. He was no great batter,
but there are times when baseball is full of surprises,
and Frank was taking no chances.</p>

<p>“Fan him, Frank!” shouted an excited rooter
from the grandstand.</p>

<p>“Let him hit it! Encourage a hard-working man
a little!” called another.</p>

<p>Coddling tried his level best, but that did not seem
good enough, for he presently walked back to the
bench, with three strikes marked against his record.</p>

<p>Snodgrass waited, and got his base, though Frank
considered that the umpire was unusually severe
with him in calling balls, when he cut the plate with
at least one of those that counted against him.</p>

<p>“Now, Hough, you know what to do!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Hough, lam it good and hard over old Billings’
head. He’ll never get another like he did that
first one. That was an accident!”</p>

<p>“You’ve got him up in the air, boys! Lead that
horse into the stable!”</p>

<p>Dozens of like cries sounded everywhere. It is a
part of the game to try and rattle the pitcher when
such an emergency arises.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>Still, that faint smile remained on the face of
Frank Allen, as he prepared to take the measure of
this hard-hitting Bellport player, who had broken the
reputation of at least one promising pitcher.</p>

<p>With two out, and men on first and third, Hough
certainly had reason to do everything in his power
to make a hit. Then came the sharp shock as the
bat met one of Frank’s curves on the nose, and the
ball went shooting down toward third.</p>

<p>Shadduck stopped the speedy one as best he could,
but it was coming like a comet, and he could not
hold it. Jumping after the ball, he snatched it up.
The chances of getting it to Paul were rather
meagre, but it was his business to try, and he shot
it for home.</p>

<p>No doubt the very rapidity of the play unsettled
him, so that he failed to send the ball exactly where
it would have cut the runner off. Paul had to reach
out after it, and then tag the sliding runner.</p>

<p>“Safe!” shouted the umpire, who was there on
the spot to see.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Paul had tossed the ball back to Shadduck,
for there was danger of Snodgrass coming
down from second while all this was going on; in
fact, he had to be driven back with threatening
gestures.</p>

<p>With two men on bases and two out, the inning
still had possibilities, and loud waxed the exultant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
cries of the Bellport rooters as they sang their school
song and made a great demonstration.</p>

<p>“Got him up in a balloon! He’s ascending, all
right, boys! Give him another push, Tony!”</p>

<p>Banghardt stepped up full of confidence, and
faced the pitcher with determination in his eye. Just
two minutes later he dropped his bat and trotted out
toward center, for the umpire had said that three
balls which sailed past him were along the strike
order—and the umpire belonged to Bellport, too, so
that there could be little doubt but what he was
right.</p>

<p>So the eighth began with Columbia still one run
to the good, and Bellport just as positive as ever
that they could not only make the lone tally necessary
to tie, but add a few more for good measure.</p>

<p>Comfort, Lanky Wallace and Billings tried to
accomplish something while they remained for a
fleeting space of time on deck, but Coddling seemed
to have taken a new lease of life, and they were
unable to connect with a single one of his elusive
benders.</p>

<p>Frank shut his teeth hard as he went into the box
in turn. He was not given to weakening, despite
all that the envious Lef had declared; and his arm
felt just as good at that minute as in the second
inning.</p>

<p>All Smiths looked alike to him, judging from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
way he struck the two brothers out, one after the
other.</p>

<p>Herb Lacy managed to work him for a free pass
to first, but after all it did him little good, for the
next batter, Bardwell, lifted a foul that Paul gathered
in against the grandstand, to the accompanying
cheers of the occupants.</p>

<p>This brought affairs down to the ninth, and all
over the field there was intense excitement.</p>

<p>“This is the lucky Bellport inning!” shouted one
fellow, encouragingly.</p>

<p>“Watch them run the game out right here!”</p>

<p>“Will they? Maybe, maybe not!” answered Jack
Eastwick.</p>

<p>Herman Hooker had jumped to his feet as Columbia
went to bat for the last time. Up to the present
he had been content to play a minor part, but now
his time had come.</p>

<p>“Give it to them, boys—give them the slogan we
love, good and strong. Hi! hi! hi! ho! ho! ho!
<i>veni! vidi! vici!</i> Columbia! Siss! boom! ah!”</p>

<p>Amid such a pandemonium Tom Budd struck out,
though he died trying to find one of those balls
which Coddling seemed to be twining around his
neck. Seymour was somewhat more fortunate. He
raised a fine fly, but unfortunately it landed in the
outstretched hands of Smith, Junior, who did not
seem to stir a yard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>Paul Bird made a lucky hit that should have been
an out, but the players were so nervous by this
time that Lacy actually fumbled the ball. Frank,
with all the encouragement that might accompany
such backing as could spring from the “best yeller
Columbia ever had,” as he jumped up and down, and
waved his megaphone violently, sent a hot liner
straight at Hough on second that nearly took him
off his feet, though he held it.</p>

<p>And then Bellport came to the bat. Every man
looked grimly confident. Clay made a hit out of the
first ball that came along, reaching out and stealing
what was meant to be a wide one.</p>

<p>How those Bellport rooters did shriek and jump!
It seemed as though they would go crazy as they
begged and implored Coddling to win his own game
by advancing the runner by a little bunt.</p>

<p>“He just can’t do it, boys!” called one fellow,
after Coddling had twice thrust out his bat and
failed to even touch the speeding ball.</p>

<p>“Give him a pair of smoke glasses; the sun’s in
his eyes!”</p>

<p>“Three times and out, Coddling—take care, old
hoss!”</p>

<p>This time Coddling, in despair, struck savagely,
and perhaps to his own surprise, tapped the ball
smartly toward second.</p>

<p>“Double ’em up!” arose the howl like a flash, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
the average baseball rooter can see the possibilities
of a play as soon as a player.</p>

<p>And that was just what happened. Seymour
snatched the ball from the ground with one hand,
leaped over to his sack, and as his foot touched the
same he threw for Lanky on first. Coddling was
caught ten feet away, and a mighty groan attested
to the strain under which the Bellport crowd was
resting.</p>

<p>Snodgrass again found that he just had to strike,
for Frank was putting them over on purpose now,
having full confidence in the men back of him.
Smash! went the ball. Lanky fell over very much
like a ten pin that has been caught by a rapidly moving
ball, but as he sat there he held up his hand to
prove that he had forked the sphere out of the air
and gripped it tight!</p>

<p>The game was over, and it had been a heartbreaking
one all around. Immediately the great
crowd flooded the ground, and the players were
swallowed up in groups of admiring rooters. Herman
Hooker led his gallant band in another cheer,
in which the defeated Bellport team came in for a
share of the shouting; after which there was a wild
rush for all means of transportation whereby the
thousands could hope to reach their homes in the
neighboring towns.</p>

<p>When the Columbia players reached the river they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
found that during their absence Abner Gould had
succeeded in repairing the motor, so that it was now
in condition to take them back home. Frank could
not be sure that his suspicions were well founded,
and hence he decided to say nothing about the matter.
If the man had been hired by his sporting
brother to delay the Columbia team, and annoy them
so that they would go upon the field nervous and unstrung,
he had been caught in his own trap.</p>

<p>Ralph West seemed anxious to speak to Frank in
private. They were on the way up the river, and
most of the boys had stretched out, talking over the
various thrilling events of the great game, when
Ralph dropped down beside Frank.</p>

<p>“I’ve been wanting to say a few words to you
ever since we left Columbia, but couldn’t get the
chance,” he said in a low tone.</p>

<p>Frank could see that he was unduly excited, and
he did not believe that this came wholly from his
clever work in the recent game.</p>

<p>“All right, Ralph; what is it?” he asked encouragingly,
for they had been good friends for some
time, and Frank knew all about certain strange
events connected with the past life of the freshman
who had made good on the Columbia nine.</p>

<p>“I went to the post-office just before we started
out,” commenced Ralph.</p>

<p>Frank started, and looked at him eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>“This is just after the first of the month, and that
mysterious letter with the money enclosed used to
always come at such a time. Well, what happened?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“I got the letter,” replied Ralph, drawing a long
breath.</p>

<p>“With the money in it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, just as before,” answered the freshman,
gulping hard as something seemed to choke him;
“and not a single word. Frank, it’s all opened up
again, and I must know who is sending me this
money. You promised to help me, and I’ll never
rest easy until I learn who I am!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>A THUNDERBOLT IN THE SCHOOL</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Let</span> me see the envelope, Ralph,” Frank said,
soothingly.</p>

<p>“Here it is, and it comes from your uncle’s office,
as before.”</p>

<p>“That’s a fact, and I’m going to ask Uncle Jim
again to tell us what he knows of this queer arrangement.
Somebody wants you to get an education, and
takes this strange way of supplying the money. It’s
been coming ever since last summer, hasn’t it,
Ralph?”</p>

<p>“Yes. And you know that Mr. and Mrs. West,
whom I always believed to be my parents, until
lately, admitted that I was only adopted by them,
taken from the poorhouse. Then there was that
poor Ben Davis. It looked to me that he might be
the one; but we saw him before he died, and he
denied that he knew anything about me. Oh, this is
a terrible fix for a fellow to be in!”</p>

<p>“Cheer up, old chap. Come around to-night, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
I’ll get father to take a hand in the game. Perhaps
he can induce Uncle Jim to explain who sends this
money on the sly through him. He said he had
promised not to tell, but dad may influence him some
way. I wouldn’t say anything more about it now.
The fellows are looking over this way, as though
wondering.”</p>

<p>So Ralph tried to change his look of anxiety and
gloom to one that corresponded more nearly with
the uproarious delight that caused the others to break
out in almost continuous cheering under the inspiring
influence of Herman Hooker.</p>

<p>That energetic individual was as hoarse as a crow
by this time, however, and had to give a rest to the
“best yelling voice that Columbia ever knew,” taking
it out in gestures that were almost tragic.</p>

<p>And so in the evening of that never-to-be-forgotten
day they arrived home, to find the town gaily
decked in bunting, and crowds of students parading
the streets cheering and singing.</p>

<p>Columbia promised to be painted red that night
of the great victory over the strong Bellport team.
Even the girls joined in the cheering and singing;
while an old cannon was made to do duty on the
green, with a salute to the boys who had carried
the colors of Columbia High to victory that day.</p>

<p>One returning pilgrim saw nothing to boast about
in the snatching of this close game from Bellport.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
That was Lef Seller. All the way back he had been
in more or less of a wordy war with various enthusiastic
rooters on the trolley, and his remarks had
been of a nature that almost caused him to be tossed
overboard.</p>

<p>“His father may own this road, but that doesn’t
excuse him for running down his own school!”
declared one of the old graduates of Columbia High,
in disgust.</p>

<p>Lef was in a very bitter frame of mind. To see
Frank come out a winner was like gall and wormwood
to his envious spirit. He racked his brain,
with the idea of finding some way of “pulling that
climbing duck down a peg,” as he muttered to himself.</p>

<p>As a rule, when Lef Seller set about discovering
some means of playing a “trick,” as he called it,
upon a school mate, he usually managed to get
there, even though the gun he held sometimes kicked
worse at the butt than it did damage from the
muzzle.</p>

<p>“Be sure and come around after supper, Ralph.
I’d ask you to go home with me now, but I know
you want to wash up and get into some other duds.
I’ll look for you,” remarked Frank, as the crowd
went ashore and walked into the town.</p>

<p>“I’ll be there. This matter is a mighty serious
one with me, and if your father will only give me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
a little help I’d be obliged,” and Ralph shook the
hand of his friend warmly.</p>

<p>“Poor chap,” said Frank to himself, as he walked
away and cast a glance over his shoulder to note
that the other had dropped his chin upon his breast
as though lost in sad thought. “It must be a nightmare
of a time not to know who you are. And then
there’s this money that comes every month from
some unknown source. Whoever can it be sending
it? Uncle Jim <i>must</i> tell, that’s all there is to it.”</p>

<p>Uncle Jim meant Judge James Decatur Allen,
away down in New York. Frank had already appealed
to him, but the lawyer in reply had said he
did not feel able to explain the mystery, since he had
given his word to his unknown client.</p>

<p>That night there was a council of war. Mr. Allen
heard the whole story, and was deeply interested in
the fortunes of poor Ralph.</p>

<p>“I’ll write to Jim to-morrow, and explain things.
No matter if he has promised, he ought to take pity
on you, Ralph, and give you a hint. If you knew
it wasn’t your relatives who were sending this
money, your mind would be at ease, I suppose?” was
what the gentleman had said.</p>

<p>“I might refuse to accept another cent of it in
that case,” replied Ralph, sturdily.</p>

<p>“While I can understand how you feel about that,
let me caution you to go slow about looking a gift<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
horse in the mouth. An education is priceless, and
even if the money came from some distasteful source,
you could still receive it and make up your mind
to positively return it some day.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir; that is what I meant to do, anyway,”
said Ralph.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile say nothing about this. When I hear
from Jim I’ll have another talk with you. Perhaps
he may see fit to confide enough to me so that I can at
least ease your mind. And, Ralph, consider that this
is something of a second home to you. We have all
grown to like you very much, my lad.”</p>

<p>Ralph could not reply, for he seemed too full of
sentiment for utterance; but he squeezed the hand
Mr. Allen gave him, and his look was eloquent
enough.</p>

<p>On the following week there was little talked of at
school but that wonderful game at Bellport. The
next one, on the following Saturday, would be
played on the Columbia grounds; and the third as
dictated by fortune in the way of a tossed coin.</p>

<p>Lef Seller was green with envy at the praise he
heard concerning the masterly way Frank had
pitched.</p>

<p>“Just as if nobody ever won a game before. Huh!
there are half a dozen to my credit, and some of ’em
as hot as that one. But did you ever hear of the
old school going crazy over my work. I guess not!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
But that Allen—oh, splash! I get sick hearing the
mention of his name!”</p>

<p>That was the way he talked to his two cronies.
Bill Klemm and Tony Gilpin, after school was out,
about the middle of the week.</p>

<p>Lef was sure of sympathy in this quarter, and it
did much to bolster up his resolution to get even
with Frank, no matter what happened.</p>

<p>“Course you couldn’t ’spect to be looked at in
the light of a hero. It’s only the fellers what strut
around and try to look like tin gods on wheels that
gets the ribbons. Look at them gals talking to him
now. He ain’t any better lookin’ than you, Lef, but
he’s just got Minnie dead struck after him,” remarked
Tony, with his usual disregard for all the
rules of grammar.</p>

<p>“Aw, let up on that, won’t you? Want to rub
salt in a feller’s cuts, I guess. Don’t I see it all,
and ain’t I just boiling with madness. She used to
think somethin’ of me before she got going with
that conceited little Helen Allen, and Frank, he
butted in. I never will forgive him for that, and it
won’t be long before he’ll get his, all right!” and
Lef nodded his head as he spoke, in a suggestive way
those cronies of his understood meant fight.</p>

<p>But the tactics of Lef were never along that order
which brought about an open rupture. Fight he
would, if he could get the object of his hatred alone,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
and have backing of his own, so that the odds were
three to one; but Lef had too much respect for the
strong muscles and agility of Columbia’s crack athlete
to risk a solitary meeting with him.</p>

<p>No matter what he had in his mind he would not
confide in either of the others. When they asked
him he simply put his tongue in his cheek and
grinned, which signs they understood meant trouble
for Frank Allen.</p>

<p>On Thursday morning, after the exercises in the
assembly hall, the principal of the school, instead of
dismissing the various classes to their rooms, asked
them to remain, as he had a communication of importance
which he wished to make.</p>

<p>Expectation was on tiptoe immediately.</p>

<p>Crafty Tony Gilpin, stealing a side look over toward
Lef, caught a fleeting glow of expectancy in
his eyes, while his manner of leaning forward indicated
that he might know what was coming.</p>

<p>“He’s gone and done it!” was Tony’s prompt
inward declaration, and immediately his admiration
for his chief was increased tenfold.</p>

<p>Every eye was fastened upon Professor Parke as
he stood up facing them. The ordinarily genial
teacher looked very sober, and this fact caused many
a heart to beat with apprehension, as various lads
imagined that some prank in which they were concerned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
had been found out, and public disgrace was
to follow.</p>

<p>“Young ladies and gentlemen,” began the professor,
who was always in the habit of addressing
the students in this dignified way, just as though his
training as a college man would allow of nothing
else, “I have a very painful duty to perform this
morning, and one I never thought would devolve
upon me here at Columbia, though I have heard of
it happening elsewhere.”</p>

<p>You could have heard a pin drop as he stopped for
a moment. Two hundred and fifty hearts were
thrilled by his words. Every one present, save, possibly,
one, wondered what it could be the professor
was about to say. Tony was still shooting those
fugitive glances across the room, and each time he
observed the actions of his comrade he kept repeating
to himself:</p>

<p>“Lef knows! He’s in this game, all right. He
said he’d do <i>something</i>, and I just reckon he has,
all right. Bully for Lef!”</p>

<p>The professor spoke again, and his voice carried
to the furthest point in that large room, so that
every one could hear what he said.</p>

<p>“I repeat that I have had a shock. I did not
believe there could be a student under my charge so
dishonorable as to attempt anything so small and
mean as this seems. And I am sure that every one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
here, save the miscreant who is guilty, will agree
with me in saying that, when you hear how he
planned to take advantage of the rest of you.”</p>

<p>Lef was licking his lips now, and trying hard to
hide the grin that seemed to want to creep over his
face. He had all the appearance of one who was
enjoying a delightful treat, and yet who, for diplomatic
reasons, did not want other eyes to note the
fact.</p>

<p>“Yesterday afternoon,” continued the Head,
slowly, while his eyes roved around the room, “I
received the first batch of examination papers from
the printers, far in advance of the usual time. I
counted them three times, and marked the number
on a slip, so that I could always be sure none were
missing.”</p>

<p>A half suppressed sigh seemed to pass over the
room. Most of the students could begin to guess
at what was coming. They understood now what
the professor intended to convey when he spoke of
every one being cheated by the work of the malefactor.</p>

<p>“Something called me away just then, and I did
a very unwise thing—thrust the packet of papers
into my desk, and left the latter open; but I never
dreamed that any one in this school could be guilty
of stealing the questions that mean the promotion of
the juniors in this year’s classes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>“I was away about half an hour. Upon returning,
something seemed to tell me that my desk had
been entered, since things were plainly disturbed.
And when I recounted the packet <i>I found just one
paper short</i>!”</p>

<p>Again he paused, and the entire assemblage
seemed to catch its breath, waiting.</p>

<p>“When I had made sure that one of the papers
was gone, my pleasure over the fine showing of
Columbia in the week just passed fled. I knew that
unless that stolen paper were found, the entire batch
would have to be destroyed, for fear lest it be passed
around, and make our examination a mockery.</p>

<p>“This morning I received a singular communication
from an unknown party, who claims that he
dares not sign his name, because it would make him
enemies; but he affirms that he saw a certain student
coming out of the office during yesterday afternoon,
and that following him up, he discovered him
looking at a piece of paper which seemed to him to
be a set of questions used in our yearly examinations.</p>

<p>“As a rule, I seldom take any notice of anonymous
communications, but in this case I feel it a duty I
owe the entire junior class to do everything in my
power to discover the guilty one. The name mentioned
in this communication was one that stunned
me; but since it has been brought before my attention,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
there seems to be nothing for me to do but
request the person in question to plead guilty or innocent.”</p>

<p>Then he swept his eyes around, while many a lad
shivered in mortal fear, until finally, they came to
a pause, and the professor exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Frank Allen, come forward, please!”</p>

<small>THE VINDICATION</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Oh!</span>”</p>

<p>It seemed as though a score of voices framed that
one word. A few of the students looked pleased
because suspicion seemed to have alighted upon a
shining mark, but the vast majority were shocked
and stunned. Helen turned as white as a little
ghost, while Minnie Cuthbert half rose from her
seat, and stared at the principal as though she
thought he had surely taken leave of his senses.</p>

<p>Frank stood up quickly. He could not help it if
his face burned just then, for any one would naturally
be confused at so sudden an accusation.</p>

<p>Almost as quickly the color left his face, and he
flashed a defiant look around, as if to discover who
it was chuckled, for it appeared that Lef could not
wholly contain himself.</p>

<p>Frank walked directly in front of the professor,
and looked him straight in the face. He bore himself
proudly, as might an innocent lad upon whom
unjust suspicion had been cast. If some enemy had
done this, Frank did not intend to let him have the
satisfaction of seeing how it hurt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>“Frank, were you in my office alone at any time
yesterday afternoon?” asked Professor Parke steadily,
as he gazed at the lad before him, and those who
knew anything about reading expression would have
seen readily enough that it was more like a look of
sincere affection that he gave the boy than one of
accusation or doubt.</p>

<p>“I was not, sir,” came the immediate response,
clear-cut and ringing.</p>

<p>“This communication, which, as I said before,
has no name attached to it, states that you probably
have that examination paper in your pocket at this
moment. Is there any truth in that assertion,
Frank?” went on the principal.</p>

<p>“So far as I know, sir, there is not. I am perfectly
willing to have any one search me over. In
fact, sir, after what has been said I <i>demand</i> that it
be done,” said the student, indignantly.</p>

<p>“Suppose you do it yourself, Frank. Place everything
in your pockets on my desk here, please.”</p>

<p>With a smile Frank started to obey. Of course,
every eye followed each of his movements, and
Lanky Wallace, who happened to be just behind Lef,
wondered why the fellow gripped his desk and partly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
arose, as his lips kept forming unuttered words, and
he trembled all over.</p>

<p>Suddenly Frank’s smile faded. He had a troubled
look on his face as he slowly drew something out,
took one swift glance at it, and then handed it up to
the professor.</p>

<p>“It’s the paper!”</p>

<p>“Oh, he had it after all!”</p>

<p>“How did it ever happen? I don’t believe he
ever took it!”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it dreadful, girls?” this last from Emily
Dodsworth, who had often tried to interest Frank
Allen in her own simpering self, but without success.</p>

<p>Frank stood there, looking straight up into the
eyes of the principal.</p>

<p>“This is indeed the missing examination paper.
The unknown party to whom we are so heavily indebted
certainly told the truth when he said it would
be found in your pocket, Frank. Are you willing
to answer me one question?”</p>

<p>“I will answer as many as you ask me, sir,” replied
the boy, without quailing.</p>

<p>“Have you ever seen this paper before, Frank?”</p>

<p>“I give you my word for it, sir, that I never set
eyes on it until I drew it out of my pocket just
now. I don’t know how it got there, unless some
fellow put it there for fun, or to injure me.”</p>

<p>A few smiled disdainfully. They were the ones<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
who had always been envious of Frank Allen’s popularity
in the school, and rejoiced to see him even
temporarily under a cloud.</p>

<p>But there were ten to one who looked terribly
stunned, and found it hard to realize that the boy
they had all admired as a shining example of honesty
and candor could even be accused of so despicable
a thing as this, the smallest, meanest cheat of
which any student could be guilty.</p>

<p>“I wish to state right here, Frank, that I believe
you are speaking the exact truth,” said the professor,
with one of his rare smiles; “and I’m going to
explain just what I mean by that, if you will all
sit back in your seats and listen.”</p>

<p>The silence became profound. Even Lef had
drawn within his shell, so to speak, at this unexpected
remark from the Head, as if he might have
been a cautious old tortoise. He scented trouble
from afar, and was preparing to put on an innocent
look. When Lef was really on his guard, it
would require a keen eye indeed to detect guilt in
his face. He could stare any one in the countenance
and lie out of any hole deliberately and
vehemently.</p>

<p>“In the first place,” went on the principal, “I have
always set it down as an absolute fact that in nine
cases out of ten an anonymous communication is
the work of a sneak, a coward, and generally a criminal,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
who wants to throw dust in the eyes of possible
pursuers, so as to effect his own escape. Either
that, or else it is his intention to ruin the reputation
of the party he accuses.</p>

<p>“It might give me more or less embarrassment,
though not anxiety, in the premises, Frank, on account
of this paper being found on your person, only
for one thing. And that was just where circumstances
conspired to make the wretch who could so
miserably plot to harm a fellow student, overreach
himself.</p>

<p>“After I had placed those papers in my desk, I
went straight to the gymnasium, where you were
practising, and called you aside. In my company
you went to ascertain about certain matters that you
had called to my attention, and where repairs were
absolutely necessary. And I wish to state emphatically
that during the half hour I was from my room
Frank Allen was actually at my side every minute
of the time until I stepped into my office again!”</p>

<p>He paused, as if to let the effect of his statement
sink into the minds of the whole assemblage. Then
there came a ripple that immediately broke into a
deluge of cheers, until the entire building seemed to
vibrate with the tremendous volume of sound.</p>

<p>Nor did Principal Parke raise a hand to assuage
the voluntary tribute to the popularity of the boy
who had been under so unjust a suspicion! Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
Amos Wellington, one of the other men teachers,
raised a hand feebly, but who cared for his protest
when the Head, by his silence, gave tacit consent to
the shouts.</p>

<p>Then Professor Parke bent over and offered his
hand to Frank, which action was the occasion for
more cheers and a tiger, as well as the school yell.
There certainly had never been such an extraordinary
spectacle seen in old Columbia High during the
twenty years of its existence.</p>

<p>And Lef shouted just as loudly as the rest! He
did not dare hold back, lest suspicion be turned his
way. He was trembling in his shoes even then as the
enormity of his iniquity burst upon him. What if
the janitor, Soggy Dolan, had glimpsed him when
he slipped out of the office, for the latter had gone
past with a step ladder on his shoulder, and might
have turned his head, unknown to the culprit.</p>

<p>Lanky thought it queer that Lef should seem so
pleased over the vindication of one toward whom he
was known to bear only ill will. He imagined that
this sudden change of heart on the part of Lef might
be placed in the same category as the suspicion said
to attach to the Greeks bearing gifts.</p>

<p>And so, after all, the incident that had been
planned as calculated to attach infamy to Frank’s
name only served to raise him still further in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
estimation of his schoolmates, and the teachers of
Columbia High.</p>

<p>And it was certainly a pleasure to have them all
swarm around him later on, to declare their satisfaction
and delight at his complete vindication.</p>

<p>Frank was far from satisfied.</p>

<p>It was a dreadful thought to realize that he had
an enemy in the school vindictive enough to do such
a terrible thing as this, simply to crush him.</p>

<p>“Ten to one I could guess who he is,” said Lanky,
angrily.</p>

<p>“Have you any proof of it?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>Lanky was forced to admit that his declaration
was only grounded on certain suspicious circumstances.
He would have told of Lef’s queer actions,
but Frank declined to listen.</p>

<p>“I’m going to try and find out the truth for myself,
Lanky; but whatever I do, I won’t accuse any
one until I can pin him down with indisputable
proof,” he said.</p>

<p>“And then what, Frank?”</p>

<p>“Well, I won’t say, but the miserable coward who
would try to strip a fellow of his reputation hadn’t
ought to be allowed to go free,” and had Lef seen
the flash in the eyes that accompanied these words,
he would very likely have trembled more than ever,
and tried to walk a chalk-line.</p>

<p>Frank sought the principal after school. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
found the professor in his office, and the other welcomed
him with a warm smile.</p>

<p>“What can I do for you, Frank? You understand
that not for a single minute did I dream that you
were guilty. I had remembered the circumstances
of your being in my company every bit of the time
while I was out of here, and the thief crept in to rob
my desk. But I would give a good deal to be able
to find out who played so mean a trick upon you.”</p>

<p>“Will you let me see the paper you received, sir?”
asked Frank.</p>

<p>“That you will find in my waste-paper basket yonder.
Now that you mention it, I can see that it was
unwise of me to toss it aside contemptuously. Have
you found it, my lad?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Frank, bending over.</p>

<p>“I see, you think it possible to recognize the writing.
But in this case the scoundrel followed the
usual custom with all anonymous letter writers, for
he simply printed the words,” remarked the
principal.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I notice he did. And the paper seems
to be just what is used by every student in school,
as the supplies come from you,” observed Frank,
still examining the crumpled sheet.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid that we may never know who did
it, unless through some accident.”</p>

<p>“Where did you find this note, sir?” continued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
the boy, eagerly, as though a sudden idea had struck
him.</p>

<p>“Slipped under my door here when I opened it
this morning. You know Mr. Dolan does not open
my office save on Saturdays, when he cleans. Whoever
put the paper under the door chose a time when
no one was likely to see him.”</p>

<p>“You threw this in the basket as soon as you read
it, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes, for, as I remarked, I was indignant,” replied
the professor, curiously wondering what all
these questions implied.</p>

<p>“And at that early time I don’t suppose you were
using your ink at all, sir?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not, Frank. What makes you ask that,
lad?”</p>

<p>Frank spread the paper, which he had smoothed
out, before the gentleman.</p>

<p>“You see, sir, whoever wrote this used ink; and
in some way or other he must have gotten a certain
small amount on his fingers and thumb. Look here,
and you will see where there is a very plain imprint
of a thumb, and from the other marks that accompany
it, I should say that it is the <i>left</i> thumb, too!”</p>

<p>“You interest me amazingly, my boy. And it is
all just as you say. I do declare, it must be the
left thumb that has left an imprint here. I see what
you have in mind, Frank. Go your own way about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
it. If you discover the guilty one, I leave it to you
entirely whether you bring him before me or not.
This is your especial affair, and you can manage it
as you please.”</p>

<p>“Well, I happened to be reading lately how they
take the imprint of criminals’ thumbs over in France,
and that no two are exactly alike. With other measurements,
it is called the Bertillon system, and has
been found to work well. There, I have made an
impression of my left thumb, and you can see, sir,
that the lines are very much unlike this one.”</p>

<p>“Frank, you are correct, and I give you credit
for so much acumen. But do you want me to call
every boy in school in here and take an impression
of each left thumb, so that we can discover the one
rascal?” smiled the principal.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sir, but I thought I’d like to try on my
own hook, to see if I could land him,” exclaimed
Frank.</p>

<p>“All right, go ahead. I give you free permission,
and wish you luck. And, Frank, perhaps you have
already some idea as to what direction you mean to
hunt first of all,” this last with uplifted eyebrows
and a questioning look.</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” said Frank, as he turned to depart
with the precious paper safe in his pocket, “I suppose
I have suspicions, but they may be unjust toward
a certain party, and I wouldn’t mention them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
to any one. Thank you, Professor, for helping me.
If I succeed, perhaps I may bring the proof to you.
It all depends upon circumstances.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes,” murmured the professor, after he
found himself alone; “I can understand what that
means. If the rascal pleads only strong enough that
generous lad will even go so far as to forgive him,
and hush the ugly matter up, for the honor of
Columbia. Would that there were more like him!”</p>

<small>THE IMPRINT IN THE CLAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">I don’t</span> believe in it, that’s all!” said Lanky Wallace,
with a shake of his head.</p>

<p>“Well, now, for my part, I’m not so hard to convince.
Just because they look alike at first glance
is no reason why it would be so if you put our
hands under a magnifier. I kind of side with
Frank,” observed Buster Billings.</p>

<p>They were gathered in a group in the gymnasium,
and chattering like magpies. A dozen or more boys
had dropped in after school Thursday afternoon, as
a drizzling rain prevented any outdoor work, and
there were many temptations for lovers of athletics
in that well equipped gym.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell me,” burst out Lanky, with
a look of scorn, “that everybody’s two hands differ,
and that yours are entirely unlike mine. I just fail
to see it, and I’m not the only one, either.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” remarked Jack Eastwick; “as for me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
I side with Lanky. You’ll have to show me, Frank,
before I’ll back down.”</p>

<p>Others of the boys began to gather around, attracted
by the animated discussion, just as Frank
had been hoping they would. He had noted the fact
that Lef Seller was in the place, not doing much in
the way of exercise, for he had been debarred from
competing in the track team or taking part in any
athletic rivalry for the balance of the term, and
could only look on and make sarcastic remarks.</p>

<p>But, somehow, there seemed to be an attraction to
Lef in the person of Frank Allen. Perhaps it may
have been on a par with the fatality that draws the
silly moth to the flame of the candle. He had tried
to wrong the other terribly, and, the plot having
failed, he seemed eager to catch anything that was
said concerning the matter by Frank or his chums.</p>

<p>So, among the rest, he lounged over to the spot
where Frank sat, upon the edge of a little table, idly
swinging his leg to and fro. Apparently Frank
never paid the slightest attention to the presence of
Lef; but, truth to tell, he was keenly alive to the fact.</p>

<p>“What’s all this talk about over here?” demanded
Seymour, pushing into the group.</p>

<p>Lanky took it upon himself to explain.</p>

<p>“Why, Frank was springing a joke on the lot of
us. He says that our two hands are totally unlike—that
if an impression was made of each fellow’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
right and left, he’d never dream they belonged to
the same body. What do you think of that, Rod.
It’s going some, for Frank, eh?”</p>

<p>The captain of the nine looked thoughtful.</p>

<p>“You may smile at it, fellows, but really I’m inclined
to side with Frank. I’ve read some strange
things along that line lately, and believe there’s considerable
truth in it,” he marked, soberly.</p>

<p>At this Lanky laughed jeeringly. He had been
taken into the scheme far enough by Frank to know
how to play his part. And out of the corner of his
eye he saw that Lef Seller had hung to the outskirts
of the crowd, listening with some show of interest
to what was said. Lef, as a rule, had been frowned
upon of late when he came around, and as no one
noticed him now, he felt encouraged to remain. No
boy likes to feel that he is an outcast among his
schoolmates.</p>

<p>“Prove it, Frank!” scoffed Lanky.</p>

<p>“Yes, make your assertion good, old chap!” echoed
Buster, encouragingly.</p>

<p>“Well, why not? And here’s a splendid chance
to make the test,” declared Frank, jumping down
from his seat.</p>

<p>He strove to act as though badgered into the exposition
of his belief, when to tell the actual truth, the
stage had all been set beforehand for just this
opening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>“What’s he going to do, boys?” asked Jack
Eastwick.</p>

<p>“Oh, I get on to his curves. See there, on that
window seat are a dozen little boxes. You know
what they contain, fellows?” cried Lanky.</p>

<p>“The modeling clay Mr. Oswald uses in his geographic
lectures!” said Tom Budd, as he placed his
hands on the table Frank had just vacated, gave a
hitch to his lower extremities, and after a whirl
through the air like a cart wheel, once more calmly
alighted on his feet.</p>

<p>“That’s just what. I’ve seen him show the topography
of a dozen countries with that stuff. It’s a
fad of Ossie’s. But what can Frank want with it?
Is he going to manufacture some artificial hands to
prove his words?” asked Jack, the doubter.</p>

<p>“Now, look here, you fellows who doubt my assertion.
I’m going to make good; not only in my own
case, but every one of you have got to be convinced
by seeing how your own hands differ in a dozen
ways. Each fellow take one of these trays, just as
I am doing. Are you game to try?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“I’m ready for the test, and I’m not giving back
a word. Convince me, and I’ll own up, but I’ve got
to be shown,” declared Lanky.</p>

<p>“Me, too!” echoed Jack, seizing a little box and
leveling the clay with a pad used for the purpose,
until it was perfectly smooth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>And Lef took the last tray! Frank chuckled when
he saw that, for he felt that there was some hope at
least that his neat little plan might not fall down in
the start through the suspicion of the one at whom
it was aimed.</p>

<p>“Bless the little innocent’s heart!” whispered
Lanky in Frank’s ear.</p>

<p>“First of all, every fellow write his name on the
tablet in front of his tray, so we’ll know which is
which,” said Frank, earnestly.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” grinned Buster, “for I declare, if I’d
want to stand sponsor for some of the paws other
fellows own.”</p>

<p>“The sentiment is kindly returned, Buster. You
are welcome to a monopoly of your own kind of
paws. Now, what, Frank?” queried Seymour.</p>

<p>“All got your signature down? Well, pad the
stuff until it’s just as smooth as the ice was last
winter on the Harrapin, up near Rattail Island.”</p>

<p>“Or as smooth as Lanky here when he’s got his
Sunday duds on,” suggested Buster, with a chuckle.</p>

<p>“Now be very careful how you press your right
hand gently down in the clay on that side of the
tray. Lift it out quietly, so as to leave a positive
impression. Got that, everybody?” Frank went on,
suiting the action to the words himself.</p>

<p>“I’m on, all right!” called out one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>“Me, too, and it’s just a dandy impression I
made!” declared Buster, exultantly.</p>

<p>“You always do, especially when you take a
header over the handlebars of your wheel. I’ve seen
it!” spoke up Lanky, ready to get back at his chum
for the various sly digs he had received.</p>

<p>Frank had his eyes about him. He knew that
Lef was following up the little experiment just as
eagerly as any of the others. It kept him near
them, and thus he could hear what they might be
talking about. If suggestions were offered concerning
the identity of the unknown who had tried to
get Frank into trouble, Lef was yearning to know
the drift of the sentiment.</p>

<p>“Now, do the same with the left hand,” Frank
went on calmly, though his heart was undoubtedly
beating faster than its wont; “and be mighty careful
not to let it overlap the imprint of the right. How
about that, fellows?”</p>

<p>“Mine is a perfect success!” declared Lanky, triumphantly.</p>

<p>“And mine’s a blooming failure. What shall I
do about it, Frank?” called out Buster, in disgust.</p>

<p>“Smooth it off and try again, until you’re satisfied
you’ve got a perfect impression of each hand,”
answered the master of ceremonies.</p>

<p>“What comes next?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>“Lay the trays down here on the table so we can
all get around. Wait just a minute, fellows. I’ve
sent up to borrow Mr. Oswald’s big magnifier. That
is going to prove my assertion so that even the
scoffers will have to admit its truth. And here comes
Alfred with the glass.”</p>

<p>Frank took one look at the contents of the tray
upon which he had written his own name. Then
he handed the glass to Buster.</p>

<p>“Examine closely. Note first that there is a considerable
difference in width. Then measure the same
finger on each hand and you will see they differ in
length. Next pay attention to the peculiar markings.
No two fingers are alike in that respect, not even
your own. Well, is it so, Buster?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“Wow! I’m a misfit all right! Somebody must
have got my other hand in the shuffle. The worst
of it is, how am I to tell which one really belongs
to the Billings family?” lamented the fat student,
sighing in pretended distress.</p>

<p>So the glass went around. Frank stood still while
Lanky followed the movement of the magnifier until
every one had taken a look, and was ready to
admit the truth of what Frank had said.</p>

<p>“No two alike in the whole bunch. I never would
have believed it,” admitted Lanky, who had been
peering at every impression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>Without appearing to do so, he had managed to
crowd several of the boys away from the table,
and among them Lef; but having seen the wonders
of the magnifying glass proven, like most of their
type they had suddenly lost interest in the matter,
and were already turning their attention toward the
parallel bars, the swinging hoops and the punching
bags.</p>

<p>Left alone at the table, Frank made a pretense
of arranging the trays just as he had found them,
now and then taking a look through the magnifier.
He had his eye on Lef and waited until the
other was engaged in some stunt at which he excelled.</p>

<p>At first Lef had been debarred even the privileges
of the gymnasium on account of his playing a miserable
trick upon Frank as the editor of the Columbia
monthly paper; but after a bit this order had
been rescinded, so that now he was allowed to join
his fellows in their muscle-building work.</p>

<p>When Frank presently saw the name of Lef Seller
written on the white tab of a moulding tray, and discovered
that the imprints of the other’s hands were
plainly stamped there before him, he eagerly held
his glass over the box. At the same time he drew
out the paper that had come to Professor Peake,
and compared the delicate tracery of lines on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
thumb with that which Lef had left behind him in

<p>There could be no possible mistake!</p>

<p>The same thumb had made both impressions beyond

<small>TOEING THE MARK</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">So it</span> was that cur, just as I expected!”</p>

<p>Frank felt a glow of indignation pass over him
at the conviction that he had by this simple but positive
means of identification discovered the thief
who had not only stolen the examination paper, but
tried to rob him of his good name.</p>

<p>He and Lef had always been at war. Bitter rivals
in all things, they had on many occasions faced
each other on opposite sides. And because Frank
usually managed to win in these contests Lef hated
him bitterly.</p>

<p>Frank was puzzled as to what he should do. His
first thought was to hasten to the principal’s office
and show him the proof of the charge he could make.
Then he shook his head. Somehow that seemed
to be too severe, for it would possibly result in the
expulsion of the other student of Columbia High.
And Frank hardly fancied having such a responsibility
thrust upon his shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>“I’ll charge him with it, and if he says he’s sorry,
let the matter go. Anyhow, the mischief’s done.
Those papers will have to go back, and others be
sent on. The little experiment has afforded me more
or less amusement, and that counts for something.
If I can only get Lef over here alone.”</p>

<p>A bright thought struck Frank even while he
was puzzling over this matter.</p>

<p>“That’s the idea—I can slip into the lunch room,
and coax him there.”</p>

<p>First of all he carried the tray of moulding clay
through the convenient door. Mrs. Louden, who
had charge of the lunch counter, was still busily
engaged. She made it a rule to linger when a bunch
of the boys were working in the adjacent gymnasium,
since that sort of thing developed enormous
appetites, and many an extra dollar found its way
into her till through this afternoon source.</p>

<p>After doing this Frank passed outside again.</p>

<p>“How?” remarked Lanky, as he sidled up alongside
his friend.</p>

<p>But this was not intended to be an Indian salutation.
Lanky was deeply interested, and wanted to
know.</p>

<p>“I was right,” said Frank.</p>

<p>There was no exultant strain to his voice such as
one might expect. Truth to tell, he felt only indignation
and disgust because of the fact that any fellow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
who had the home training Lef Seller enjoyed
should descend so low as to endeavor to ruin a companion’s
reputation.</p>

<p>“Then soak him, pard! Show the measly skunk
no mercy! He ought to be kicked out of Columbia,
and that’s the truth!” gritted the other.</p>

<p>Lanky knew his chum’s tenderness of heart, and
was afraid that Frank might be too easy with the
culprit.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget what you promised me when I let
you in on this!”</p>

<p>“Oh! yes, you tied my hands good and hard, so
that I couldn’t let out even one measly little squawk.
But my word is as good as my bond. Have it your
own way, but I certainly hope you’ll finish that fellow’s
loping so that he’ll never try any more of his
funny business on you again,” grumbled Lanky.</p>

<p>“That would be almost too good,” laughed Frank;
“and now, while I go in the lunch room will you
manage to tell Lef that some one wants to see him
there?”</p>

<p>“Sure I will,” grinned the other.</p>

<p>“And try to keep the boys out for a little while,
will you, Lanky?”</p>

<p>“If it’s possible, but you know as long as any
fellow has a nickel in his jeans, and the spirit moves,
he can’t be kept away from Mother Louden’s grub
corner with a derrick. But I’ve just thought of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
funny story I’ll tell ’em after Lef has gone to the
block.”</p>

<p>Lanky hurried away, while Frank passed through
into the other room.</p>

<p>Two minutes later Lef hurried into the place and
looked around. He seemed disappointed, and
frowned. Possibly the conceited fellow may even
have imagined from the air of mystery that Lanky
assumed when telling him some one wanted to see
him, that one of the girls, even Minnie herself, was
there with a message.</p>

<p>Frank beckoned to him, earnestly. He saw Lef’s
face turn red at once, but since no one could ever
accuse the fellow of a lack of nerve, it was not
strange that he started toward the corner where
Frank was standing hiding something behind him.</p>

<p>When Lef reached the other he was sneering as
he said:</p>

<p>“Was it <i>you</i> sent for me? If I’d known it, I
wouldn’t have taken the trouble to come, and you
understand that, or you wouldn’t have had Lanky
make me believe it might be Minnie.”</p>

<p>Frank flushed a trifle at the mention of that name,
for he and Lef had long been competitors for the
favor of the prettiest girl in Columbia.</p>

<p>“That would have been too bad, for you, Lef,”
he said, quietly.</p>

<p>“Oh! say you so. Perhaps you’ll take the trouble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
to tell me why?” observed the other, apparently as
bold as ever, though Frank could detect a little uneasiness
about his manner that told of newly awakened
fears.</p>

<p>“Because if you hadn’t come I’d have taken the
matter up with Professor Parke,” and Frank
looked him straight in the eye as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Matter—what matter?” demanded Lef, shivering
at the same time.</p>

<p>Frank stepped aside, and in so doing exposed upon
the table one of the little trays used by Mr. Oswald
when instructing his pupils in the art of the mapmaker.</p>

<p>“That’s your tray, Lef; it has your own signature
on the tag to make certain.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I don’t deny it. But what under the sun
are you driving at, Frank Allen? I’m beginning to
believe that all the praise that’s been showered on
the mighty factor in saving that punk game last
Saturday has gone to his head, and that you’re getting
ratty.”</p>

<p>“Wait and see. There’s the imprint of your left
hand as plain as day. You heard me say that no
two fingers in the world would make the same impression,
or thumbs either for that matter. Well
I’m going to show you that the <i>same thumb</i> can and
always will make a similar impression; and many a
rascal has gone to jail just because of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>With a quick motion Frank flirted a paper before
the astonished eyes of the boy who stood there. Lef
turned as white as a ghost, and had to grit his teeth
to keep from having them chatter with his sudden
fright.</p>

<p>Had the ground opened and threatened to swallow
him just then he could hardly have been more
astonished and dismayed. It is the feeling of the
rogue whenever his own handiwork arises unexpectedly
to confront and confound him.</p>

<p>“I guess you know that paper, Lef, all right,” said
Frank, meaningly.</p>

<p>Lef pretended to lean forward to read it, but in
reality he was trying to shield his face until he could
screw up a little of his ordinary courage and brazen
assurance.</p>

<p>“Rats!” he exclaimed at length, though his voice
trembled almost piteously, and instead of the customary
fire in his eyes they seemed to be filled with
a dumb entreaty; “I see that you’ve got the paper
the professor said came to him. What of it?
I ain’t got anything to do with that, and nothing
you can say will make anybody believe it, Frank
Allen!”</p>

<p>“But you signed it yourself, Lef, as plain as day!”
declared Frank.</p>

<p>“What’s that? Think I’m a fool, do you? Sign
nothing! The fellow who wrote that scribble was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
wise enough to make only his mark,” sneered Lef.</p>

<p>“Well, in this case his mark is as good as his
name,” went on Frank.</p>

<p>Lef began to tremble. He realized that there was
something terrible back of these words, so calmly
spoken by the boy he had come to fear more than
any one he had ever known.</p>

<p>“Tell me how?” he demanded, with one more
futile attempt at bluster.</p>

<p>Frank pointed to the blur on the edge of the
sheet, where a thumbmark was plainly visible in ink.</p>

<p>“That’s your signature, Lef! You never thought
when by accident your thumb made that blur that
you were signing your name here, but that’s just
what you did. The proof lies in that little drawer
where you made the impression of your left hand.
Alike as two peas they are, Lef. That would convict
you in any court. It stamps you as the low,
mean cur that you are, who would try to ruin a
companion’s reputation just to gratify his love of
revenge!”</p>

<p>Lef stared at the small tray of moulding clay in
which the plain impression of his hands could be
seen.</p>

<p>“You—did—that as a trap!” he gasped.</p>

<p>“Well, just as you will. If it was a trap you fell
into it neatly enough, and you’re caught now. The
evidence is there, and if I showed it to Professor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
Parke I guess we wouldn’t be bothered with you at
Columbia High much longer,” went on Frank,
sternly.</p>

<p>“Say, you wouldn’t be mean enough to do that,
Allen, I hope? I acknowledge the corn about this
thing. I did do it, but more to get you knocked off
the baseball team than anything else,” said Lef, in
pretended humility.</p>

<p>All the while he was edging toward the table; but
if Frank suspected his design he took no measures
to stop the other.</p>

<p>“What good would that do you?” demanded the
one Lef had injured.</p>

<p>“I used to pitch for Columbia, yes, and won many
games for them up to the time you knocked me out.
I’ve never got over being sore for that. Lots of
times I’ve tried to get even. You know how. Sometimes
I succeeded in giving you a jolt; but more
times the shoe was on the other foot. This seems
to be one of that sort. I never thought the old man
had you with him all the time he was out of his
den.”</p>

<p>“But you haven’t answered my question—how
would it profit you even if I was dropped from the
team?” continued Frank, persistently.</p>

<p>“Why, I had some hope that when the team was
left without a pitcher enough influence might be
brought to bear on the Head to let me take my old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
place in the box again. That’s all I did it for;
Frank; I give you my word.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you look at such things differently from
the way others do; and perhaps you even now believe
it wasn’t such a dirty trick after all. I’m just
wondering whether I’d better accept an apology
from you and let it go at that, or take the matter
before Professor Parke.”</p>

<p>Lef made a sudden movement of his hand, and
the little tray was dumped from off the table, depositing
its contents in a mass upon the floor.</p>

<p>“What did you do that for?” demanded Frank.</p>

<p>“Destroying the evidence, that’s all. I guess you’ll
have some difficulty now about proving the ridiculous
assertion you just made. Of course I never
dreamed of playing such a mean trick as stealing
that paper, and hiding it on you! And, Mr. Smarty,
my word ought to be as good as yours, any day!”</p>

<p>He thrust his face out as he spoke, in his usual
disagreeable way, thinking he had played a clever
trick on the other.</p>

<p>“You’re wrong there. Although you’ve destroyed
that little print you so kindly made me you can’t
very well get rid of the original so easily,” said
Frank, pointing down at the left hand of the other.</p>

<p>And Lef fell back in sheer dismay. He had forgotten
that it was the mark of his thumb to which
Frank referred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>“The professor could easily insist upon you convicting
yourself by stamping another thumb-print
alongside this one. He asked me if I wanted to have
every fellow in Columbia make his mark, so that
the right one could be found; and I told him I preferred
going about it in my own way.”</p>

<p>“Then—he knows?” asked Lef, in new alarm.</p>

<p>“About the imprint on the paper, yes. He admitted
that it was a possible way for identifying
the one who had taken it out of his desk,” was
Frank’s answer.</p>

<p>“And you’ve got to tell him then?” with a groan,
and a sinking of his head on his chest.</p>

<p>“No, he said he’d leave that to me entirely; but
that, if I succeeded, and gave him the proof he’d
do the rest!”</p>

<p>Like all cowards caught in their own toils, Lef
was not beneath playing upon his emotions in order
to secure immunity. To the surprise of Frank the
other suddenly grasped his hand and there seemed
to be a look of sincere agony on the face that was
thrust close to his.</p>

<p>“Then I hope you’ll be above giving me away,
Frank. I’ve been a cur. I admit it, and don’t deserve
to be let down easy; but I’d hate to be expelled
from school, because, you know, my mother
has set her heart on my graduating, and going to
college. It would break her all up. I haven’t been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
what I ought to be, but this is going to be a lesson
to me, sure it is!”</p>

<p>Frank deep down in his heart believed the fellow
was a hypocrite; but under the circumstances what
could he do, now that Lef had brought his mother
into the affair? Frank knew her well, and believed
she was an estimable lady who certainly deserved
to have a better son than fortune had given her.</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether to believe you or not, Lef;
but at any rate I guess I’ll keep my own counsel, for
a while at least,” he said.</p>

<p>And as Lef moved away, he was secretly laughing
in his heart at the easy way he had tricked his
rival.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>A STUNNING SURPRISE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Everybody</span> report on the field this afternoon for
practice!” called Lanky.</p>

<p>It was on Friday morning, and most of the members
of the nine chanced to be within hearing distance
of his shout.</p>

<p>“Bellport will be over here to-morrow, and with
their teeth set to drop us down a peg,” remarked
Jack Eastwick, who, while no ball player of moment,
always manifested the greatest interest in the success
of the team.</p>

<p>“Hope the weather keeps on as fine as it is to-day,”
said Tom Budd, as he turned a few flipflaps
around the group; but the boys were so accustomed
to his antics that they paid little attention to them,
although a stranger would have stared with amazement
to see his really wonderful stunts.</p>

<p>“And that Frank’s arm is as full of ginger as it
was last Saturday. My! but he did shoot them in.
I heard some of the Bellport players talking about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
it after the game. They’re afraid of Frank, fellows,
actually afraid!”</p>

<p>Lef Seller, who was hanging near, turned his head
away to conceal the sneer that persisted in settling
upon his face when he heard Buster make this announcement.</p>

<p>It was like gall and wormwood to Lef to hear
any one say good things of Frank Allen. Every
time this happened it seemed as though he were
being robbed of something that by right should belong
to him.</p>

<p>When they gathered that afternoon on the diamond,
Lef was around to watch and criticise as the
humor seized him. And Tony Gilpin also made
his appearance, although seldom seen of late on the
athletic field.</p>

<p>“No show this afternoon to get it, Lef,” he remarked,
as he threw himself down near the other
on the grass under a tree that grew outside the
confines of the grounds.</p>

<p>“Rotten luck! Of course he wouldn’t carry it in
his baseball uniform. That means we’ll have to
wait our chance. And till I get my fingers on that
paper I don’t dare so much as peep for fear that he
shows me up,” grunted Lef.</p>

<p>From which it may be readily understood that he
was even then laying plans looking to another robbery,
this time in order to destroy all evidence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
his participation in that other offense. So one crime
often leads to another, after the first step has been
taken along the broad way.</p>

<p>The boys were soon batting and throwing, while
waiting for the arrival of enough fellows to make
up the scrub team.</p>

<p>Captain Seymour was a clever manager and he
had noticed just where the team had seemed a bit
weak during that great game with Bellport. It was
now his aim to strengthen those lame spots as best
the short time allowed.</p>

<p>Those who had made errors of judgment were
to be put through a course whereby they might reasonably
remedy that defect. If a fielder had shown
wavering in the matter of running in on a fly or
backing away, he was to be bombarded with high,
vaulting ones until he seemed perfect.</p>

<p>And so it went on. Columbia just then had no
regular coach, since the instructor at the school,
who had played that benevolent part with them
earlier in the season, had been called away by the
illness of his father.</p>

<p>“Who’s missing?” called Seymour, as he began
to pick out his men, and arrange with the captain
of the scrub for the opening of a little five-inning
game.</p>

<p>“All here but Buster Billings!” announced some
one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>“And there he comes toddling along now!” another
called out.</p>

<p>“Buster never would hurry if the world was coming
to an end,” said Lanky.</p>

<p>“You wrong him there. Send a fly out in his
territory and see him go. Once he makes a start
and he can whoop things up like a wild broncho on
the plains. The only trouble with Buster is he can
hardly stop after he gets wound up. I saw him
knock down a whole section of a board fence once,”
laughed Frank.</p>

<p>“Who’s he got with him?” asked “Bones” Shadduck.</p>

<p>“It’s a gentleman stopping at his house. I saw
him come last night,” one of the boys answered
quickly.</p>

<p>“Mr. Billings is having lots of company lately.
I met another gentleman at the game last week who
said he was visiting at their house,” remarked Jack
Eastwick.</p>

<p>Buster came puffing up, his face rosy as ever, and
a set grin upon it.</p>

<p>“Hello! fellows, a little late, am I? Well, Rome
never was built in a day. Plenty of time to do all
the practicing we want. And since we’re going to
have a real hot game of it why I thought I’d bring
an umpire along!”</p>

<p>He pointed to the gentleman at his side, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
was smiling as if pleased to be among such a lot of
happy-go-lucky young athletes.</p>

<p>“Reminds me of my salad days at Princeton, boys.
As George here says I’ll be only too glad to prove
of any assistance to you, either in the way of umpiring,
or giving you a few pointers,” the tall man
remarked.</p>

<p>Buster threw out his chest, and the light of a long-delayed
triumph shone in his eyes as he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Fellows, allow me to introduce my friend, Coach
Willoughby!”</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>More than a dozen pairs of dilated eyes stared
first at Buster and then toward the smiling and bowing
gentleman with the athletic build, who began
throwing off his coat as though anxious to get down
to business.</p>

<p>For a long time past Buster had been quoting
Coach Willoughby as an authority on all manner
of sports in the gymnasium and on the field. By
degrees his comrades had grown to look upon
this personage as an imaginary party, and it
had of late become a regular habit with them to
shout every time Buster started to quote what his
patron saint would advise under such and such circumstances.</p>

<p>Imagine their amazement, then, to have him not
only prove the truth of this wonderful man’s existence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
but to actually have him there on their
humble athletic field to coach them in their work!</p>

<p>“Hurrah! three cheers for Buster!” whooped Jack
Comfort, as though by that means they might in
some measure atone for all the indignities they had
heaped upon the head of the fat student in times
past.</p>

<p>“And three for Coach Willoughby!” echoed Paul
Bird, throwing up his catcher’s mitt.</p>

<p>They were given with a will, while the object
of the attention, Buster, assumed an attitude, and
allowed a beautiful smile to light up his good-natured
face.</p>

<p>Ralph was to pitch for the scrub. Taken in all
there was a pretty good set of players back of him,
and Frank knew that he would have to do his best
unless the regulars wanted to take chances of being
beaten, which would have a demoralizing effect upon
the team just at the threshold of their second struggle
with Bellport.</p>

<p>Ralph never pitched better. He had that wonderfully
elusive ball of his working in a way that
deceived the heaviest batters most alarmingly.</p>

<p>Coach Willoughby proved his thorough knowledge
of the game right from the start. He gave
Paul several little pointers that opened the eyes
of the catcher to some of his faults and weak places.
More than this, he frequently called the players of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
the batting team about him and explained how certain
plays could be made with far greater chances
for success than by the older methods they were
following.</p>

<p>“Sure Coach Willoughby is right up to date,”
grinned Buster, when one of his mates remarked
that the old Princeton player must have kept track
of the game ever since leaving college.</p>

<p>When the fourth inning had ended, with just one
more to play, for the afternoon was waning, the
score was very close, being just five to four, in favor
of the regulars, and most of these runs had been
the result of errors rather than a weakness on the
part of either pitcher.</p>

<p>In this inning Frank put on every ounce of steam
he could muster. The result was the complete discomfiture
of the enemy, who could not even manage
to connect with the ball.</p>

<p>“Fine work, my boy!” complimented the coach
and umpire; and Frank blushed, since it must mean
something to be spoken to in this way by so old and
experienced a Princeton graduate as Coach Willoughby.</p>

<p>Not to be outdone, Ralph, too, exerted himself in
this inning. One little pop fly that was gathered in
by the first baseman was the result of his labor; and
the scrub team came in, perspiring freely, but grinning
with the chase they had given the regulars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>“Columbia High has reason to be proud of possessing
two such clever young twirlers as these boys.
I’m going to see that game to-morrow, if I have to
break an important engagement to do so,” declared
the gentlemanly umpire, earnestly, as he walked with
several of the players through the town on his way
to Buster’s house.</p>

<p>Buster was apparently the happiest fellow in town.
Every time he looked at the sun-burned gentleman
he seemed to be saying:</p>

<p>“Maybe you’ll believe me now, fellows—maybe
you’ll listen when I quote my favorite authority.
This day has seen my complete revenge, and I’m
satisfied!”</p>

<p>“By the way, do we pass the post-office, George?”
asked Coach Willoughby; “for you see I forgot to
tell them at the office to address me here in care
of your father, and there might be an important
letter waiting for me.”</p>

<p>“We can stop in and see, sir,” remarked Frank,
eagerly; but Buster did not notice that he was more
than ordinarily interested.</p>

<p>“Then let’s do so, please, for here is the building.
Wait for me boys, or will you come in?” and with
Buster and Frank at his heels the old Princeton
player pushed through the doors.</p>

<p>He stepped up to the window where Harvey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
Brooks waited upon the patrons of the general delivery
department.</p>

<p>And then Frank heard him say in a matter of
fact tone of voice:</p>

<p>“Anything here for Mr. Pliny Evans Smith?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, one letter for you!” came the answer.</p>

<p>The gentleman athlete received it, tore the end
off and was speedily devouring the contents. Frank
looked at Buster, who turned as red as a turkey
gobbler, and then gave a hysterical little gurgle.</p>

<p>The evidence seemed plain that this wonderful
Coach Willoughby had been stamped a fraud of the
first water!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>ON THE RIVER ROAD</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Hello!</span> boys, what’s wrong here?”</p>

<p>Coach Willoughby looked first at Buster’s glowing
and confused face, and then toward Frank’s smiling
countenance.</p>

<p>Buster simply pointed to the envelope which had
fallen to the floor. As the truth broke upon the
mind of the other he laughed heartily.</p>

<p>“Out of their own mouths are the wicked conspirators
condemned. See what a nice mess you’ve
coaxed me into, George! Here I am apparently unmasked
before this fine, mettlesome prize pitcher of
yours.”</p>

<p>He turned to Frank, and assumed a little more
serious look as he continued:</p>

<p>“My name is Willoughby, only that and nothing
more. I am a Princeton graduate, and, as you have
seen, I’ve been something of an all-around athlete
in my day, too. Recently I have been doing some
umpiring in a minor league, and as my wife doesn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
like the idea of seeing my name printed in such a
connection I use the one of Pliny Evans Smith.
That’s all there is to it boys, I assure you.”</p>

<p>“You’ve done wonders for our team this afternoon,
sir, and if we only had the benefit of such
advice oftener it would be greatly to our benefit,”
declared Frank.</p>

<p>“Thank you for the compliment, my lad. My
heart is always with the boys, and I believe I’d stop
to witness a good game of ball even though it threatened
to cost me a slice of my fortune. And Frank,
once upon a time I <i>was</i> a pitcher; even if I did go
to the well once too often,” the visitor laughed.</p>

<p>“I wish you had shown me a few more tricks
about pitching, Mr. Willoughby,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“Oh! I will, gladly,” said the ex-Princeton man,
readily enough, “although most of the games I knew
have been outlawed by time.”</p>

<p>Some of the girls were playing basket-ball upon
the school green. The sight appealed to Coach Willoughby,
and he expressed a wish to stop over a brief
time to witness the conclusion of the fiercely-contested
game.</p>

<p>Among the rest, Helen Allen and Minnie Cuthbert
were doing pretty good work for the side they happened
to be on.</p>

<p>The visitor applauded certain plays, and almost
before any one knew it he was suggesting others<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
that opened the eyes of the girls to the fact that
they had an authority on sports with them.</p>

<p>So Buster was called upon to introduce his father’s
friend, and for half an hour Coach Willoughby
entered into a free lecture of advice connected with
the fascinating exercise of basket-ball.</p>

<p>And when finally the lesson came to an end, Frank
walked down the street with both the girls, nor did
he turn in at his own gate, but continued on until
Minnie had been safely escorted to her home.</p>

<p>He was conscious of the fact that Lef Seller saw
him, for they met face to face; but Lef assumed a
pleasant look and acted as though he was the last
fellow in Columbia to think of bearing malice.</p>

<p>If Frank could have seen how he pounded the
pillows about when once safe up in his own room
at home, muttering wild threats as to what he would
do sooner or later to the fellow who had cut him
out of all the good things in life, he might not have
whistled so cheerily as he hurried back home for
supper.</p>

<p>It was the night before the big battle with Bellport
on the home grounds of Columbia High. The whole
town seethed with anticipation of what the following
afternoon might bring forth. Hundreds of anxious
eyes scanned the bright heavens, and tried to
predict the weather that was to be meted out to
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>Even the girls were adding their prayers to the
clerk of the weather so that he would grant them
a fine day like the preceding Saturday had been.
There was so very much at stake in connection with
that game. If Columbia won, the championship pennant
was theirs for the year; if she lost, then another
game must be played to decide the matter,
thus prolonging the agony a whole week!</p>

<p>There was to be no more practice in the morning,
for Seymour believed his men were all in apple-pie
condition, and that too much work might make them
“go stale.”</p>

<p>Hence they would be allowed to do whatever they
pleased during the morning, providing every one
turned out at three sharp in the afternoon, for the
game was to begin at three-thirty.</p>

<p>It was in the morning that Frank appeared at
the house where Ralph boarded. The other saw
him far down the street, and was out on the stoop
by the time Frank arrived. He looked eagerly at
the visitor, as though a hope had flashed into his
mind that the other brought news.</p>

<p>“How are you feeling this morning, Ralph?
How’s that arm? Hope you didn’t try it out too
hard yesterday afternoon. There’s no telling, you
know, and perhaps you might be called on to do
your duty to old Columbia to-day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>Ralph looked at his friend, and his eyes began
to show anxiety.</p>

<p>“Oh! I hope you’re not going to say something
has happened to knock you out, and this such an important
game, too?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Now I should have known that you’d jump to
such a conclusion, and it was silly of me to put it
that way. No, there’s not the slightest thing the
matter with me that I know of, Ralph. My arm
feels just fine, and I think I’m fit to pitch the game
of my life; but as they say, you can’t most always
sometimes tell. Perhaps they may knock me out of
the box to-day,” laughed Frank.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it can be done,” declared Ralph.
“Why, there were only three clean hits made off
you last week; and from the way you put them in
yesterday, I firmly believe you’re ten per cent
stronger now than you were a week ago.”</p>

<p>“But they may have gauged my delivery then,
and be on to most of my little tricks, you see. Besides,
I heard that during the week they have had
that Clifford pitcher, Gus Hartigan, tossing them up
every p. m., and our boys say that he is a ringer
for a certain Frank Allen in his style of delivery.”</p>

<p>Ralph looked surprised at hearing this. Nevertheless
he would not confess that he entertained
the least doubt about the ability of the boy he admired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
to make the heavy batters of Bellport “look
small.”</p>

<p>“I only hope nothing happens to make me break
into that game. I’m afraid that I’m too green as yet
to go up against such seasoned veterans as those fellows,”
he observed, with a shake of the head to
emphasize his fears.</p>

<p>“You’re too modest, old fellow, by half. Don’t
you call our regular nine just as well seasoned, and
didn’t you hold us down to five hits yesterday, and
one of those a base scratch? I’d just like to see
those hustling batters from the smoky town breaking
their backs trying to get up against that fine
healthy ball you throw, that’s all,” and Frank felt
of the muscle in the arm of his comrade, at the same
time raising his eyes as if in wonder.</p>

<p>“But you didn’t come here to tell me just that,
Frank?” continued Ralph! “there’s something more,
isn’t there?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, to tell the truth, I wanted to have a
quiet little chat with you.”</p>

<p>“All right. Will you come up to my room?”
eagerly asked Ralph.</p>

<p>“I hate to stay indoors this beautiful June morning.
Get your cap and let’s walk out along the river
road. We can be alone there, and at the same time
enjoy what both of us love—Nature.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>“All right, Frank. Wait up just a minute, will
you?”</p>

<p>In a short time they had left the confines of the
town behind them, and found themselves under the
trees along a favorite drive that followed the course
of the picturesque Harrapin river.</p>

<p>The spring rains had come rather late, and the
water was unusually high for the time of year. It
was boiling along at quite a merry pace, gurgling,
and in some places creating quite a furore.</p>

<p>“Now, what was it you wanted to tell me,
Frank?” asked Ralph, when they had been walking
briskly along for a mile or so, with Frank so busied
in his thoughts that he had apparently quite forgotten
the real reason for their morning exercise.</p>

<p>“Why, to be sure. Excuse me for seeming to
neglect it so, old fellow. Truth is, I was bothering
my head over a personal matter, and wondering
what influence that fellow Lef Seller could bring to
bear that would ever induce Minnie to go out riding
with him; for I saw them start off as I was on the
way to your house.”</p>

<p>Frank possibly turned a bit red as he spoke; but
then every one knew just how much he thought of
Minnie; and it had stabbed him to the quick to see
her seated in that fine vehicle of the Sellers, with the
grinning Lef at her side.</p>

<p>Cudgel his brain as he would, Frank could remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
no cause he had given her for treating him
this way. They had parted on the preceding evening
with a laugh, and Minnie had seemed just as
much pleased to be in his society as ever. And yet
she had bowed to him rather frigidly, he thought,
as he met them; while Lef could not for the life of
him restrain that contemptuous grin.</p>

<p>Ralph understood. They must have driven up
the river road, then. That, in a measure, would
explain just why Frank chose to walk that way.
Upon the freshman’s face a look of real sympathy
gathered; but he was too wise to attempt to express
it in words.</p>

<p>“I can see the tricky hand of that Lef Seller
somewhere back of this thing, and you can bet he’s
said something or other to set her against you,
Frank,” he did manage to remark.</p>

<p>“I wonder if he would dare, knowing that I can
break him if I choose,” muttered Frank, as he mechanically
put his hand into his inner coat pocket.</p>

<p>Then he began to feel more hastily, a look of
concern coming over his face. By the time he had
covered every pocket in his garments he smiled
grimly.</p>

<p>“Well, a fellow has to get up bright and early in
the morning to keep ahead of that cunning old fox!”
he said, bitterly.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Frank?” demanded his companion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
who had been surveying his actions with
wonder written all over his face.</p>

<p>“I had something that seems to have taken wings
and flown away, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“But you act as though it concerned Lef,” Ralph
kept on.</p>

<p>“It did, though I don’t doubt that he’s burned
the paper before now. Just how it was taken bewilders
me. I was out last night, yes, and in a
bunch of fellows at the class meeting. You know
we’re getting up something of a surprise on the
seniors, in the shape of the annual supper and dance
which the juniors give to the graduating class. Lef
was there, but he avoided me all night. The only
fellow I could suspect would be that sneak, Asa
Barnes, who seemed to want to be unusually confidential
with me. And doubtless he swiped the
paper at some time when I wasn’t paying much
attention; for I’ve been told that he can play all the
sleight of hand tricks of a magician.”</p>

<p>“Paper—you keep saying that, and I don’t understand?”
expostulated Ralph.</p>

<p>“No more you do, Ralph. And I’m going to tell
you now, only it’s to be a dead secret between us.”</p>

<p>“I’ll never repeat a word of it without your permission,”
remarked Ralph; at the same time thinking
how strange it was that his companion kept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
pushing this matter forward ahead of the affair
that concerned him, Ralph, so deeply.</p>

<p>“You remember Professor Parke telling about the
anonymous note he received?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course; and is that the paper you mean?
What were you keeping it for, and why should Lef
want to get hold of it?” asked Ralph, quickly.</p>

<p>“Oh! you’re a little too rapid. Listen. On that
paper was a little blur. I made it out to be the mark
of some one’s left thumb, and the professor agreed
with me.”</p>

<p>“What! did that have anything to do with what
you were telling us Thursday afternoon in the gym
about finger prints, and all that stuff?” flashed the
astonished freshman.</p>

<p>“Everything to do with it, since that was only a
little dodge of mine to get Lef Seller to make a
plain impression of his left thumb. And, Ralph,
it corresponded exactly with the mark on the paper!”</p>

<p>“Well, I declare, you do wonderful things, Frank!
I never heard of anything quite so clever as that.
Did you accuse him of it when he went in the lunch
room?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Of course he denied it first. Then I told
him how I knew. He knocked the tray that carried
the imprint of his hands, on the floor, and defied
me; but I simply stated that he could be made to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
show the print of his thumb at any time by the
Head!”</p>

<p>“Good! What did he do then?” continued the
eager Ralph.</p>

<p>“Knuckled down and pleaded with me not to give
him away. Promised to turn over a new leaf and
all that,” said Frank, shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p>“But you surely didn’t believe him?”</p>

<p>“No, but you see I couldn’t find it in me to tell
on him, as it would mean his being expelled. But
Lef knew that he was in my power just so long as
I held that paper with the thumb-print on it.”</p>

<p>“I see. And, slippery customer that he is, he hired
that other scamp to steal it out of your pocket. That
was an easy thing for Asa to do, if all they say about
his palming is true. Then it’s gone, as you say!”
dolefully remarked Ralph.</p>

<p>“It seems so. And that accounts for his perky
airs this morning. He was laughing at me, partly
because he felt he could snap his finger in my face,
and then because Minnie had gone riding with him.
Oh! well, I’m not going to bother my head about
Lef Seller and his evil fortunes. If Minnie—but
the least said about that the soonest mended, I
guess,” and Frank closed his lips resolutely.</p>

<p>“Then perhaps you won’t mind going back to my
affairs again, eh?” insinuated the freshman.</p>

<p>“I declare I must ask you to forgive me again,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
Ralph, for being so neglectful of your interests. I
only wanted to see you to say that father has heard
from Uncle Jim, and that he writes he is coming
up here to Columbia and will see you personally.
Uncle Jim also says that——”</p>

<p>But what the New York lawyer wrote was fated
not to reach the ears of the party so deeply interested,
just then at any rate. A scream smote the air,
coming from some point around the nearest bend of
the river road, and accompanying this the boys heard
a wild voice, and the confused trample of a horse’s
hoofs!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>A TIME FOR QUICK THINKING</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">What</span> is that, Frank?” cried Ralph, in excitement.</p>

<p>“Sounds like a horse running away!” replied the
other.</p>

<p>Ralph saw his comrade’s face turn ashy white.
Then he remembered something Frank had said only
a short time before.</p>

<p>“Oh! what if it is Lef’s horse!”</p>

<p>Frank only groaned, and shut his teeth hard together.
But at the same time he started to run forward.
He had only taken half a dozen paces, when
something shot around the bend.</p>

<p>“There it is, Frank!” shouted Ralph, ready to do
anything in his power to assist his friend, yet hardly
knowing just what to attempt first.</p>

<p>He thought of swinging his arms above his head
wildly, of waving his hat, as he had read of cowboys
doing when they wished to turn runaway
steers; but then the river road at this point was narrow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
and if the frightened animal ever swerved, it
was almost certain to topple over into the water,
which was both deep and swift.</p>

<p>“It’s them—Lef and Minnie!”</p>

<p>The white lips of Frank formed these words as
he still staggered onward, though there was little
need of this. Surely the plunging horse, mad with
terror, would reach him before he could take half
a dozen breaths.</p>

<p>What could he do to bring the beast to a halt?
He saw Lef half standing up and sawing wildly at
the lines, dragging the horse’s head from side to
side with the energy of his action. But what almost
froze the blood in Frank’s veins was the sight of
that pitiable, shrinking figure cowering down in the
seat just behind.</p>

<p>How well he remembered that bright red dress.
He had thought the girl never looked so pretty as
the day she first wore that; and he mustered up
courage enough to tell her so, too. And now—Frank
gulped something down that threatened to
choke him, and tried to set his muscles for a mad
spring when the runaway horse came up with him.</p>

<p>“Get out of the way! You’ll scare him into the
river!” howled the badly-rattled Lef, as he continued
to saw away at the lines as if for dear life.</p>

<p>That was just what Frank thought would be the
best thing that could happen. As it was, an upset<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
might cost one or both lives, if the occupants of
the swaying vehicle were hurled upon the rocks
at the side of the road.</p>

<p>Instead of getting out of the way, as Lef seemed
to want, he stood as if rooted there. He even did
more, for he snatched off his hat and waved it in
order to make the horse sheer.</p>

<p>“Stop that, you fool!”</p>

<p>Lef fairly shrieked these words. He evidently
thought Frank had taken leave of his senses, and
would bring about a disaster. On the contrary, the
boy in the road had calculated wisely, and saw
that there was a chance of bringing that wild race to
a halt without a terrible smash.</p>

<p>It turned out exactly as Frank had figured. The
animal, startled at seeing this figure in the middle
of the road, with wildly waving arms, and uttering
hoarse shouts, jumped to one side.</p>

<p>There was the hill to the right, and hence the
only way in which the beast could leave the road was
in the direction of the river.</p>

<p>It lay close to the thoroughfare at this point; indeed,
passersby had always been in the habit of
pulling up right there to admire the magnificent
view up and down the romantic looking stream.</p>

</figure>


<p>Horse and vehicle shot over the bank, and with
a terrific splash vanished in the swirling water. It
seemed too bad that necessity compelled the sacrifice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
of that much admired red dress, Frank thought,
but there was no other way.</p>

<p>“They’ll drown! Oh! my, what a splash! Frank,
run! run!”</p>

<p>It was folly for Ralph to shout after this fashion,
for his companion was on the jump even before
the horse had touched the surface of the river.
Frank had eyes for only one thing, and that the
figure of Minnie.</p>

<p>As he ran he saw the vehicle behind the swimming
horse. Lef was hanging to it desperately, as
badly frightened a boy as ever lived; for, strange
to say, he could not swim a stroke, having a mortal
dread of water.</p>

<p>He was trying to yell something, but had swallowed
so much of the river that his words were next
to unintelligible. But Frank had by now discovered
another struggling figure a little back of the vehicle
and horse.</p>

<p>“It’s Minnie!” was what his white lips framed
as he madly jumped down the bank, tearing off his
coat as he went. How he ever managed to free
his feet from the low shoes he was wearing, Frank
never knew, for he had not the faintest recollection
of doing anything of this sort.</p>

<p>Now he was in the river, and swimming with
all his power toward that splashing form which, because
of the glimpses he had of the bright color, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
knew must be the imperiled girl. Her dress seemed
to be helping her to keep afloat, though this would
only last for a minute or so, when it must become
soaked, and serve to drag her down.</p>

<p>The water was very deep at this point. Moreover,
the current had a full swing, and swept along
rapidly. On the other hand, fortunately, Minnie
was only a comparatively few yards away from the
shore, so that the boy did not have to cover any great
distance before reaching her.</p>

<p>As he swam Frank was shouting hoarsely, his
strained eyes fastened upon the object of his intense
solicitude.</p>

<p>“Keep it up, Minnie! Fight hard! I’m coming
to you! It’s all right!” was the burden of his encouraging
cries.</p>

<p>Then he reached her, and began to tow her toward
the bank. The girl was almost hysterical with
fright, so that Frank was put to it to avoid having
her arms wrapped about his neck. Dragging her
thus, and all the time trying to soothe her by encouraging
words, he gained foot after foot.</p>

<p>“Here! this way, Frank!”</p>

<p>Ralph had waded into the water until it was up
to his waist. He also held out a stout stick he had
snatched from the ground. And when the fingers
of the swimmer closed upon the knob at the end of
this friendly club he knew it was over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>In another minute he had emerged from the water,
still holding fast to the form of Minnie. But the
girl did not faint. Far from it; she was now filled
with indignation toward the wretched Lef, who had
been drawn out of the river by the horse, and was
even then dripping on the low shore. The subdued
animal made no effort to continue his mad
flight; the cold water had taken all this desire out
of him, and he looked about as dejected as his
master.</p>

<p>Frank was immediately engaged trying to wring
some of the water out of the girl’s skirt, and at
the same time seeking to cheer her up, for she was
now sobbing hysterically after her recent double
fright.</p>

<p>Lef, finding that his horse would stand, now
pushed toward the group. His teeth still chattered,
more from recent fear than anything else. At the
same time he was full of anger toward Frank, who
had as usual been on the spot to win the laurels while
the husks came his way.</p>

<p>“What did you do that for? The whole thing’s
your fault, Frank Allen! Minnie can blame you for
her ducking; and you might have cost one of us a
life. I believe you did it just to have a chance to
play the hero part you’re so fond of!”</p>

<p>So Lef sputtered as he shook his hand in front
of Frank’s face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>The stooping boy looked up. There was a smouldering
fire in his own eyes, for he believed that only
for the cowardly nature of Lef and his inability to
manage the horse this thing need not have occurred.</p>

<p>“Look there, <i>you</i>!” he said, sternly, pointing down
the road.</p>

<p>Lef, looking, saw a furniture van coming along.
It took the entire width of the narrow river road,
and was at a spot where cruel rocks abounded on
either side.</p>

<p>“You must have met that thing. The horse would
have dashed to one side, and the buggy been overturned
among those rocks. And you can understand
what must have followed. That’s why I made him
shy! I knew it was ten times safer for you both to
be dragged into the river than thrown out down
the road!”</p>

<p>Lef was mute with horror. He realized that this
quick-witted boy had sized up the situation in a
second, and acted promptly.</p>

<p>After all, there was no damage done save to their
ruffled feelings, and Minnie’s lovely red dress. But
the girl would not speak to Lef, even when he asked
her if she would get into the vehicle again.</p>

<p>“Frank, you’ll walk home with me, won’t you?”
she said, turning to him, with the same old glow
in her blue eyes.</p>

<p>“Only be too glad; and besides, I think the exercise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
would be the best thing for you after your ducking.
Ta! ta! Lef. The next time you ask a girl
to go out riding be sure you take a horse you can
manage.”</p>

<p>Lef could not make any reply. He was too full
of anger to speak, and turning away he went back
to his horse. After the furniture van had passed he
jumped in and sped the animal, now tractable
enough, down the road. The three pedestrians
stepped aside to let him pass; but not a word was
said, although Ralph did wave a hand mockingly
after him, as if speeding his homeward flight.</p>

<p>“What caused the runaway, Minnie?” asked
Frank, as they walked on, after Ralph had secured
Frank’s coat and shoes, the warm sunshine and air
rapidly drying the water-soaked garments of the
party.</p>

<p>“I really hardly know. Something I said must
have made Lef angry, for he began to whip the
horse unmercifully, although I told him it was cruel.
We had turned to come back, you see. Oh! I was
so frightened! I’ll never go riding with him again.
I only hope my mother will never know,” she said,
entreatingly.</p>

<p>“She won’t from me, and I can answer for Ralph
here,” said Frank, promptly.</p>

<p>Half an hour later the boys parted from Minnie
and turned toward Frank’s house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>“What’s the matter with your arm, Frank?” asked
Ralph, who had been noticing that the other kept
feeling of it every now and then.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I bruised it against a rock when I
jumped in; and, hang the luck, of course it happens
to be my pitching wing. You may have to get in
that box to-day, after all, Ralph, and fight for the
glory of Old Columbia,” the other said, soberly.</p>

<small>THE OLD PRINCETONIAN’S ADVICE</small></h2>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Oh!</span> I hope not!” exclaimed Ralph, in dismay,
as he eagerly pounced on the arm Frank had been
rubbing.</p>

<p>“Come in with me, and I’ll see what some liniment
can do for it,” remarked the other, calmly; but it
was evident from his manner that he believed there
might be something more serious the matter than a
slight bruise.</p>

<p>When Frank had stripped, so that his arm could
be examined, it was found that he had a nasty black
and blue mark as a result of coming in contact with
a rock in his impetuous dash into the river.</p>

<p>“The worst of it is that the muscle is affected.
Every time I close my hand it causes intense pain.
I couldn’t do that hundreds of times during the
afternoon. Ralph, it’s positively up to you to-day!”
he said, finally.</p>

<p>Ralph sighed deeply.</p>

<p>“I’m awful sorry. Not that I won’t do my level<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
best to take your place; but only for this I believe
we would have won that pennant to-day. It’s fortunate
there’s another game to follow,” he said, trying
to cheer up.</p>

<p>“We’ll get this game, all right, don’t worry about
that. Before the sun goes down perhaps every fellow
will be shouting the praise of the new pitcher.
I’m just anxious to see those Bellport batters try to
size up that spit ball of yours.”</p>

<p>“That’s mighty white of you to say so, Frank.
And you can depend on it I’ll do my level best,”
returned the other, firmly.</p>

<p>“No fellow can do more. And now, suppose we
return once more to that affair of yours. Twice
we were interrupted when I started in to tell you,”
and Frank pushed his guest down into a comfortable
sleepy-hollow chair.</p>

<p>“Oh! yes. Do you know I’d forgotten that entirely,
with so much other excitement going on. You
said your uncle wrote he intended paying your folks
a visit soon, and would meet me. I hope he makes
up his mind to tell me all he knows. It means everything
to me, you see,” returned Ralph.</p>

<p>“I intend to make him tell. He just can’t go
back to the city again without letting either father
or else myself know all he does. But perhaps that
may not amount to much after all, Ralph.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Frank?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>“Why, you see, perhaps this mysterious person
who wants to do you some good, and yet hide his,
or her, light under a bushel, may have taken measures
to send the money each end of a month to my
uncle, and that he doesn’t know himself who really
hands it over to him,” Frank continued; for he
feared that his friend might allow his hopes to soar
too high, only to meet with grievous disappointment.</p>

<p>Ralph sighed and shook his head.</p>

<p>“I see what you mean, and I’ll try not to be too
sanguine. But I do hope something will come up
soon to relieve this awful suspense. And now I
want to forget all about that, and remember only
the game—and Columbia High!”</p>

<p>“Good boy, Ralph! You’re made of the right
stuff. And never let it occur to you once that we’re
going to lose this game, no matter if the score is
five to one at the end of the seventh inning. Depend
on the boys to do their part in slamming out
the ball, while you pitch steadily away like a machine.”</p>

<p>Ralph soon took his departure.</p>

<p>The news would soon creep around Columbia,
and many of the enthusiastic supporters of the school
team must feel a quiver of apprehension when they
learned that reliable Frank Allen could not pitch
that afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>His enemies would crow over the fact. Doubtless
some of them, inspired by the malicious tongues
of Lef and his cronies, might even whisper that
Frank had been overtaken with a case of “cold feet,”
and shirked his duty.</p>

<p>Ralph went straight to the home of Paul Bird.</p>

<p>The morning was still young and there would be
plenty of time for the new battery to practice together,
and arrange all needed signals. Ralph had
not as yet played a regular game with Paul behind
the plate, so that it was necessary they should come
together, since so much depended on their acting in
concert.</p>

<p>As it happened, Buster was out walking with the
visitor at his house, and seeing a couple of boys
hard at work in a lot, they drew near. To his surprise
he discovered that it was Ralph and Paul.</p>

<p>“Here, what does this secret work mean? Going
to spring a surprise on the enemy when they show
up this p. m.?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Then you haven’t heard?” asked Paul, eagerly.</p>

<p>“About what? Goodness gracious! don’t go telling
me that anything’s happened to Frank!” ejaculated
Buster.</p>

<p>“He won’t be able to pitch this afternoon, and
Ralph has to go in. That’s why we are tossing a few
here, so as to get in touch,” replied the catcher.</p>

<p>“What happened? Has Frank fallen sick? Did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
he get waylaid last night on the road home from
the meeting. I’ve known pitchers to be pounded in
order to keep them out of a game. Tell me, won’t
you, fellows? I’m quivering like a bowl of jelly
with eagerness. This <i>is</i> a nasty mess.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I don’t know,” returned Paul, with a smile
at Buster’s anxiety, and the look of grief on his red
face, “it might be worse. Frank’s a dandy pitcher,
but I guess he has little on Ralph here. If he gets
that spit ball of his working right it’s going to be
one, two, three for Bellport.”</p>

<p>“But is Frank hurt; I must know?” insisted the
other.</p>

<p>“He got a bruise on his arm this morning while
we were out walking. Nothing serious, but it interferes
with his muscles when he grips a ball. He
is going to be on the field, and if they knock me
out of the box, why, Frank will have to go in, no
matter how he feels. But I hope it won’t be so bad
as that,” smiled Ralph.</p>

<p>“Well, suppose you let my friend, Coach Willoughby,
give you a few pointers that may be useful.
He’s seen a lot of pitchers in his time, and
used to throw them in for the Tiger once himself,”
suggested Buster.</p>

<p>“Oh! if he only would, I’d be ever so much
obliged. You see, Mr. Willoughby, I’m only a tenderfoot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
at this thing, and I’ve got heaps to learn!”
cried Ralph.</p>

<p>“No doubt of that, my lad, but if yesterday’s performance
is a fair sample of your ability to puzzle
the batter, I rather think you’ll have some of these
heavy Bellport hitters knocking holes out of the atmosphere
this afternoon. What you need fear most
of all is lack of confidence. Get it in your head that
you <i>can</i> do a thing, and that you’re just <i>going</i> to do
it, and nine times out of ten you <i>will</i> do it.”</p>

<p>And then the old Princeton “grad” began to put
the young battery through a course of instruction
that delighted their hearts. He even took a turn
in the box himself and sent some sizzling hot ones
down that rather staggered Paul.</p>

<p>“You may be a ‘has-been’ as you say, sir, but I
wouldn’t like to stand up before you if you were
in your prime,” remarked the catcher, as he blocked
a ball that nearly took him off his feet.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Paul. That’s as sincere a compliment
as I ever received. And now, Ralph, one more
turn here in the box and I think you will have exercised
that wing of yours quite enough for this morning.
Be careful of it, so that you don’t take cold
between now and ball time. I’m satisfied that the
good people of Columbia will see a game worth the
price to-day.”</p>

<p>Ralph felt ten per cent. better after having this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
talk and work with the veteran player. He knew
that he could carry out his end of the arrangement
if he only managed to keep up his courage and confidence.</p>

<p>So it was in that frame of mind he ate his lunch,
and later on dressed for the expected game.</p>

<p>Although it was hardly yet half-past two o’clock,
a steady stream of people had commenced to pour
out in the direction of the big field where the Columbia
sports were carried on, from baseball and
running, to football in the autumn.</p>

<p>This level tract was at a considerable distance
from the town. Being between Columbia proper
and the town of Bellport down the river, it could
be reached by the trolley, or vehicles. As many
people did not care to ride, and the walking was
good, the mile of road was covered with pedestrians,
many of them boys in squads, all earnestly discussing
the coming contest, and the chances of victory.</p>

<p>Hundreds were also pouring into the place from
Clifford above. Cheated out of a show in the contest
by a perverse fate, the fans of that town were
just as anxious to see which of their rivals would
come out ahead in the series.</p>

<p>Ralph was a very modest boy. He purposely
took a roundabout course to the ball field, when
starting forth, as he wished to avoid meeting with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
the crowds that thronged the trolley cars and the
main road.</p>

<p>He knew he could easily make the grounds in
good time, though his detour would cause him to
pass over two miles instead of one. And just then
Ralph really wanted to have a little more time by
himself to brace up for the exciting event that was
before him.</p>

<p>So, making a turn, he walked through the woods.
The smell of the cool, shady spots under the trees
seemed to soothe his nerves, and he was rapidly getting
the firm grip on himself that he wanted, and
which would be so essential to the success of his
contemplated work.</p>

<p>He had no thought of anything happening to
detain him on the way. Frank might have enemies
bitter enough to attempt such mean tactics, but thus
far Ralph did not know of any person who would
have an object in keeping him out of the game, unless
it might be that undesirable character, Watkins
Gould, who staked his money on Bellport that other
day, and lost.</p>

<p>So Ralph had covered about half of the distance,
and was aiming for a spot where, emerging from
the thick woods, he knew he could strike a road leading
directly to the athletic field.</p>

<p>“What was that?” he asked himself, suddenly
stopping in his quick walk, for he thought he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
caught a sound not unlike the sobbing of a child.</p>

<p>It seemed to well up from the thicket on his right.
Perhaps Ralph may have had one fleeting suspicion
that there could be a trick connected with the matter;
but when he heard the piteous cry a second time
he plunged straight toward the spot.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>LED BY A KINDLY FATE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Well</span>, I declare!”</p>

<p>Ralph West stood rooted to the spot for a couple
of seconds, as he allowed this exclamation to escape
from his lips.</p>

<p>Perhaps he had half expected to have a couple of
fellows pounce upon him as he pushed the branches
aside; which would account for the manner in which
his fists were clenched, and his teeth set.</p>

<p>What he saw was an entirely different spectacle.
A little girl was seated on a hummock, rocking to
and fro, with her childish face tear-stained, and full
of bodily anguish.</p>

<p>The blood upon her hand told that she must have
fallen and hurt herself badly. No doubt it was the
sight of the blood that frightened her even more
than the pain.</p>

<p>Ralph sprang forward, and the tear-stained face
was turned up to him eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>“What’s happened to you, little one?” asked the
boy, as he bent down.</p>

<p>Already had he taken a clean handkerchief out,
and shaken it from its folds. Thank goodness he
had supplied himself liberally, with a hot game before
him. Picking up the mangled hand, he saw
that it was in need of immediate attention, as possibly
a heavy rock had fallen on the fingers.</p>

<p>Ralph began to tenderly wrap his handkerchief
about the torn fingers, at the same time speaking
soothingly to the child. She had ceased crying and
was looking at him wonderingly. Doubtless his
baseball uniform astonished her greatly.</p>

<p>“It fell on me,” she managed to say, pointing to
something near by; and Ralph saw that his surmise
had been correct in so far as it concerned a stone.</p>

<p>“But what are you doing here; where do you
live?” he asked, anxiously.</p>

<p>The child should not be left here in these woods
with so serious a wound as the crushed fingers would
likely prove. And yet his time was not wholly his
own, since he must be on the field presently in order
to practice before the calling of the great game.</p>

<p>“I’m Mary Smalling,” said the child, with utmost
confidence and simplicity, as if every one ought to
know after that.</p>

<p>Ralph had caught sight of a dinner pail on the
ground near by. It was empty, too, which fact gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
him the impression that the little girl might have
been on the way home after carrying a noonday meal
to her father.</p>

<p>He had an indistinct recollection of hearing the
name before. Perhaps it was in connection with a
new family that had come to live on the outskirts
of the town; but just then in his confusion of ideas
he could not for the life of him tell whether it had
been on the other side along the river road, or to
the west.</p>

<p>“Where does your father work?” he asked, on a
hazard.</p>

<p>“For Mr. Gregg,” came the immediate answer.</p>

<p>“At the mill, the flour mill?” asked the boy,
quickly.</p>

<p>A nod of the little auburn-crowned head answered
him. Then Ralph knew what his duty was.
He remembered that the mill was only a quarter
of a mile away from the spot where they were at
that moment. Perhaps the child’s home might be
even closer, but he could not take the chances of
hunting for it.</p>

<p>“I’m going to carry you to your father, Mary.
You’re not afraid of me, are you?” he asked, bending
down again; for some one ought to get her to
a doctor without much delay, so that it might be
discovered whether any bones had been broken by
the cruel fall of that heavy stone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>“Me? Oh! no,” she said, instantly, which
pleased Ralph more than he cared to say, for it told
him his manner had inspired confidence in the little
maid.</p>

<p>So he gathered the wee mite of humanity up in
his arms, and having decided upon which direction
he should take, strode off.</p>

<p>“But—my dinner pail! Daddy won’t like me to
lose it!” wailed the child, after they had gone fifty
paces.</p>

<p>Nothing would do but that Ralph must return
in order that she might clutch it in her one well
hand. Then again he made a start. It was provoking
that an accident like this should delay him
just when minutes were of so much value. But
Ralph could not have had the heart to leave that innocent
child crying there alone in those dense woods
even though a dozen ball games depended on his
showing up at a certain time.</p>

<p>The little one proved more of a load than he had
anticipated. Several times he would have been glad
of a chance to rest and put her down; but the passage
of time kept staring him in the face.</p>

<p>Ralph hoped that this encounter would not prove
to be his undoing. He had grave fears that the
strain of carrying the child so great a distance
might shake his nerves in a way he would feel to
his disadvantage during the progress of the game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>Little did the boy realize how a benevolent fortune
was playing directly into his hands, and that
the very thing he feared might be a calamity was
fated to be but another stepping stone on the road
to good luck.</p>

<p>The little girl had stopped crying. He could see
her bright eyes looking up into his face every time
he glanced down. As he staggered along Ralph
kept talking in his cheery way, and no doubt that
had considerable to do with her appearance of contentment.</p>

<p>At last, when Ralph feared he could hold out no
longer, he heard the familiar whirr of the big water
wheel, and caught a glimpse of the mill through
openings in the trees.</p>

<p>“We’re almost there, Mary, and you will soon be
with your father,” he said, smiling down at her.</p>

<p>“That will be nice. I’m glad you came,” the
child answered; and Ralph believed there was enough
of genuine gratitude in those simple words to repay
him doubly for all his trouble.</p>

<p>All he begrudged was the time it had taken. Only
for that he would not have cared had the distance
been thrice as long, for it was certainly a pleasure
for this lad to do a service to a helpless little creature
in trouble.</p>

<p>He reached the road over which the supplies of
the flour mill were carried, as well as the milled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
product hauled away. It was easier going now.</p>

<p>“There’s my daddy!” exclaimed Mary, struggling
up in his arms.</p>

<p>Her voice must have reached the ears of a man
who was working just outside the door of the mill,
for he turned hastily and looked toward them. A
moment later and he started on a run toward Ralph.</p>

<p>The boy could see that his face betokened alarm.
It was not exactly a bad face, though there were
the marks of dissipation upon it, showing that
Mary’s father had not always led the best sort of
a life.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter. What’s happened to the
child?” he cried, hoarsely, as he came closer to the
boy, who had stopped in his tracks now.</p>

<p>“Anyhow, he loves the little girl, that’s sure,”
thought Ralph, as he saw the look of agony that
made the man’s face turn white.</p>

<p>“She’s hurt her hand quite badly. I think a rock
must have fallen on it while she was picking wild
flowers, or reaching into the burrow of a chipmunk.
Be careful, sir, it’s bleeding a lot,” said Ralph, as
the man took her from his arms.</p>

<p>“But I didn’t lose the bucket, daddy, like you said
I would!” cried the child, still gripping the tin
tightly.</p>

<p>“Never mind the bucket, darling; it’s your hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
I’m thinking about now. Where did you find her,
my boy?” asked the man, eagerly.</p>

<p>Ralph was almost panting after his long and tiresome
walk, burdened as he had been. He was only
waiting to get his breath, so as to say that the little
girl ought to be taken to a doctor without delay,
and then expected to start in a hurry for the athletic
field.</p>

<p>“About a quarter of a mile from here, and in the
woods. I think she must have been on the way
home. I was taking a roundabout way to the baseball
field, you see, where I have to pitch a game for
Columbia this afternoon,” Ralph explained, seeing
the man look inquiringly at his suit.</p>

<p>“And you turned out of your way to carry my
child all the way here! It was kind of you to do
that, my boy, and I won’t forget it in a hurry. This
girlie is everything in the world to me, I tell you.
Thank you a thousand times for your trouble, and
any time Sam Smalling can do anything to return
the favor you just call on him, hear?” and he
squeezed Ralph’s hand with emphasis.</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s all right. I wouldn’t have minded it
a bit, only I was afraid I might be late for the game,”
said Ralph, preparing to go.</p>

<p>“And everything depends on the pitcher, I know.
That makes it all the kinder of you, turning aside
as you did. I hope you’ll stop in and see us some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
time, my boy. We live in the Grant cottage, on
the road to Menhaven. The girl will be glad to see
you, and her mother, too, I wager.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try to, some time later. But I hope you can
get her in to town to let a doctor look at those fingers
without delay. If a bone is broken it ought to be
set, you know,” said Ralph, over his shoulder, for he
had started off.</p>

<p>“Hold on a minute, my boy. There’s our wagon
and horse right handy. I’ll speak to the boss, and
take the rig to drive to town right away. And by
jumping in you can get to the baseball grounds
quicker than if you walk; besides having a little rest.
Wait up a minute. You haven’t told me your name,
either, you see.”</p>

<p>Halted by these words from the father of Mary,
Ralph turned on his heel. He saw that what the
other had said was true, and that by waiting a bit
he could ride with advantage to himself.</p>

<p>“I guess that’s a fact, and if you’re going right
away I’ll hang on behind. To tell the truth, I’m a
little mixed up in my bearings, and might get lost
if I went without a guide. You see, I’ve only lived
about here since last fall. My name’s Ralph West!
Why, what’s the matter, sir?” for the man had
started back while he was speaking, and stared at
him as if suddenly given a shock.</p>

<p>“Ralph West? Do you mean to tell me that <i>you</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
are the boy, then? And that some fatality has
brought <i>you</i> to do a favor for me and mine? This
is the last straw on the camel’s back. I was weakening
before; now I don’t see how I can hold out!”</p>

<p>And hearing these muttered words, Ralph realized
with a thrill that Sam Smalling, the father of the
child he had assisted, must know something about
his mysterious past!</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>SAM SMALLING MAKES A PROMISE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> the time being Ralph forgot all about the
fact that he was nearly due on the baseball field that
afternoon. Sam Smalling’s words seemed to indicate
that he might be in possession of some knowledge
concerning the things which the boy was fairly
wild to know.</p>

<p>“Oh! what do you mean?” he asked, in trembling
tones, as he came back to clutch the sleeve of the
man’s shirt eagerly, and fasten a pair of anxious
eyes on his face.</p>

<p>Smalling was visibly shaken. He tried to avoid
the gaze of Ralph at first, and looked down at his
feet in the manner of a man whose sins had suddenly
arisen to confound him.</p>

<p>“You must know something about me, Mr. Smalling,
or you wouldn’t have said what you did. I’ve
only recently learned that I was adopted by the
people I’ve always believed to be my own parents;
and ever since that time I’ve been just wild to learn
who I am. Do you know?” demanded Ralph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>The other moved uneasily, and his rather shifty
eyes still refused to meet the penetrating gaze of
the boy.</p>

<p>“Mebbe I do, and again mebbe I don’t. Come
and see me again, boy, and perhaps I can help you
find out what you want,” he muttered, with a shake
of the head, as if not wholly satisfied to speak more
plainly off-hand.</p>

<p>“But why not now? Oh! if you only knew how
I lie awake nights wondering and wishing, I’m sure
you’d tell me all you know, sir. It’s a terrible thing
to be ignorant of who you are! No matter what
my parents may have been, I’d rather know than
keep on this way. Please tell me!” Ralph pleaded.</p>

<p>“Not just now. It comes on me too sudden like.
I must have time to think it over and see just where
I stand. There’s more than one thing to be considered.
But I’ll tell you this, Ralph, after what
you’ve done for my little girl to-day I’m mighty
much inclined to break my word, and speak soon.”</p>

<p>“Then I suppose I’ll just have to wait, Mr. Smalling;
but I do hope you’ll not be too long. When
can I come to see you about it, sir?” Ralph went on,
meaning to strike while the iron was hot.</p>

<p>“Come to-night, then. And I reckon you can
expect to hear something that will do you good. But
we must get off now. I’m anxious to get Mary to
town, so a doctor can look after her hand; and as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
for you, the sooner you drop in on that baseball
game the better, I reckon,” said the man, hurrying
over to where the owner of the flour mill seemed to
be working.</p>

<p>Then Ralph remembered that his time was not
his own—that there would by now be a tremendous
crowd assembled on the athletic grounds, watching
the snappy work of the rival teams, and his absence
must be causing the Columbia High players considerable
anxiety, to say the least.</p>

<p>Some of the spectators, who happened to know
that Ralph was slated to go in the box in place of
Frank Allen, would even be cruel enough to declare
that the novice must have been attacked with a case
of stage fright, and retreated from the grounds
after seeing the immense throng which he would
have to face.</p>

<p>So Ralph tried to forget all his personal affairs
for the time being, and think only of his duty toward
his school.</p>

<p>Now that she had found her father again, Mary
seemed to be satisfied. Ralph used another spare
handkerchief to make a loop in which the injured
hand could be suspended; and the little girl thanked
him with her bright eyes.</p>

<p>By the time this had been done Smalling came up
with the team. Ralph lifted the girl to the seat beside
her father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>“Come up here with us; plenty of room, Ralph,”
said the man; and seeing that he spoke truly, Ralph
hastened to comply, although he had been about to
swing himself up behind, with his feet dangling
over the tailboard.</p>

<p>Consulting his watch, a little nickel affair costing
but one dollar, he discovered that he should have
been on the field before this. The rescue of Mary,
and carrying her all this way, had consumed considerable
time.</p>

<p>Smalling urged the horses to do their best. He
was naturally anxious about his child, and, moreover,
knew that minutes were exceedingly precious
to the boy who had stepped aside to do this kindly
act.</p>

<p>“I reckon you won’t be sorry for what you did,
boy,” he said, turning his head as they pushed forward
over the country road.</p>

<p>His words gave Ralph the keenest sort of satisfaction.
He was thrilled with the thought of how
his good star must have been in the ascendent when
it urged him to investigate the meaning of those
apparent sobs in the bushes.</p>

<p>“And to think how near I came to passing by,
thinking it might only be some fellow trying to
trick me,” was what Ralph was saying to himself all
the while.</p>

<p>The man who drove seemed to be consumed with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
a desire to learn something more about the other,
for he began to ask questions.</p>

<p>“Did the old folks treat you white, Ralph?” was
his first demand.</p>

<p>“If you mean Mr. and Mrs. West,” replied the
other, quickly, “I can say yes, perhaps far better
than I deserved, since I was none of their flesh and
blood. I think I’ve always looked on them just as
other boys do their own parents—up to lately, when
money started to come to me every month from an
unknown source, and then doubts began to awaken
in my head, for I saw them talking together often
as though trying to make up their minds to tell me
something.”</p>

<p>“Money—how was that?” asked Smalling looking
deeply interested.</p>

<p>“Why, along last summer I got a letter from the
office of a New York lawyer. It had forty dollars
in it, and just a couple of lines saying that I was to
accept the gift with the idea of getting an education,
and that the same amount would come every month.”</p>

<p>“Phew! Looks like something had touched his
heart after all! Forty dollars, eh? And has it always
come, Ralph?” asked the driver, keeping his
eyes fixed upon the horses’ heads, as if unwilling to
meet the boy’s questioning gaze.</p>

<p>“Yes, always. That was how I came to Columbia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
to attend the high school, for I was wild to get an
education,” replied Ralph, soberly.</p>

<p>“Just so, and naturally, too. You come by that
desire all right, I guess,” muttered Smalling, who
seemed to be more or less embarrassed.</p>

<p>A strange thought came into Ralph’s mind. What
could this confusion on the part of the other signify?
He looked eagerly into the face of the little girl sitting
beside him. Truth to tell, he was wondering
if it could possibly be that Mary might turn out to
be his sister!</p>

<p>And, as if something had told Smalling what was
flitting through the brain of the boy, he turned his
head and looked at him.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, it ain’t that, Ralph. You’re nothing to
me. I’ve been a bad man in my day, but I give you
my word I’d never desert a kid that belonged to me.
Drink has been at the bottom of all my evildoing,
though it is my own fault. Latterly, I’ve managed
to get a grip on myself, and p’raps it ain’t too late
to wipe out some of my past. You come to see me
this night, lad, and don’t fail. I reckon I’ll be in a
frame of mind to let a few things drop. I ought
to, I know. There’s something more than accident
in our meeting up in this way. It means Fate,
that’s what!”</p>

<p>“I’ll be there, without fail, sir. How could I keep
away? And, oh, I hope and pray you won’t change<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
your mind between now and night,” faltered the boy,
as he put his hand out and touched that of the driver.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was that confiding touch that did it, or
possibly Smalling’s eyes chanced to fall upon the
neatly bandaged hand of Mary just then, and he
was overwhelmed by a sense of the debt he owed
this lad.</p>

<p>At any rate he impulsively grasped that extended
hand and squeezed it warmly.</p>

<p>“I’m going to do more than give a half promise,
Ralph. Take my word for it, that when you come
to-night I’ll clear up pretty much all this affair about
who and what you are. And, lad, you needn’t worry
any more, because it’s goin’ to be all right,” was
what he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you ever so much for that promise!
It will give me heart to do my level best to-day; and
I have need of such a spur, I assure you, Mr. Smalling.
There, I had a glimpse of the baseball field
just then; and listen, what can they be shouting
for?” asked Ralph, as a mighty cheer came rolling
toward them.</p>

<p>“Some feller has made a star play in practice, I
reckon. I’m some keen on ball myself, and calculated
on getting over later to the game. P’raps I’ll
stop off on the way out from town, though the girl
had better be took home to her ma.”</p>

<p>“Your wife is living, then?” asked Ralph, even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
while he was trying to steady his nerves for the sight
that would soon break upon his vision as he entered
the big enclosure where Columbia High boys usually
met to enjoy baseball, football, and most outdoor
sports.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, and Mary has several brothers and sisters.
But she always wants to be the one to fetch
my dinner,” and from the way he looked down at
the girl it was evident that she must be his favorite.</p>

<p>“Here’s where I must jump out, sir,” said Ralph,
suiting the action to the word as they came opposite
a big open gate.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll look for you to-night?” asked Smalling,
his eyes ranging up and down the clean built figure
of the lad approvingly, and with a light kindling in
his eyes.</p>

<p>“Unless they do me up so well this afternoon that
I can’t walk, I’ll be there,” replied the other, smilingly.</p>

<p>“Goodby, Ralph,” said the little girl, holding out
her well hand. “I won’t forget how nice you was.
And I’m going to do up these for you, too,” pointing
to the several handkerchiefs Ralph had used to bind
up her hand, and make a sling.</p>

<p>“All right. That’ll be fine. Goodby, both of you,
until to-night!”</p>

<p>He turned away with a sigh. It seemed almost
too good to be true that he was going to hear great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
news so very soon. Ralph could hardly believe that
he was not dreaming.</p>

<p>And then as he entered through the gate vehicles
used, he saw the athletic field and the tremendous
throng that packed it.</p>

<small>“PLAY BALL!”</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Who’s</span> the umpire, Lef?” demanded Bill
Klemm.</p>

<p>“Name’s Willoughby. Used to be a pitcher for
Princeton away back, they say.”</p>

<p>“What they got him in for? Where’s Grigson,
the regular umpire?” continued Bill, as though his
comrade might be an information bureau.</p>

<p>“Laid up, I hear. Captain Seymour says this feller
beats Grig all hollow. Guess they’ve got it all
rigged up to throw the game for Columbia. I
wouldn’t put it past that Frank Allen and his bunch
of toadies,” growled Lef, still sore after his experience
of the morning.</p>

<p>“But they say Frank ain’t going to toss ’em over
to-day. Got hurt this morning in some way. One
fellow told me he jumped in the river and hauled
Minnie Cuthbert out. Nobody seems to know just
what happened, but his arm’s black and blue where
he hit a rock,” went on Bill, at the same time eyeing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
his friend closely, for he had heard Lef chuckle as
though quite tickled.</p>

<p>“So that’s what happened to little Frankie, was it?
Served him right. He ought to mind his own business.
I reckon I’d tamed that hoss down soon if
he hadn’t cut in when he did,” grumbled Lef.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” demanded Bill, suspiciously, and
showing keen interest.</p>

<p>“Never you mind. Tell about it another time. I
know just what Frank Allen did. He’s always playing
to the gallery, you know. Then who’s going to
pitch for Columbia?” asked the other, turning the
question aside.</p>

<p>“They say Ralph West,” replied Bill.</p>

<p>“That country kid. Why, these heavy batters of
Bellport will just eat him alive. It’s a pity they
can’t give <i>me</i> a chance to show what I can do. I’m
better by long odds than I was last year, and I held
’em down to three hits one game. Remember that,
don’t you, Bill?”</p>

<p>“Course I do. But I’m lookin’ for that come-on.
Why ain’t he showin’ up and doin’ some practicin’?
P’raps he’s got the big head, and thinks he don’t
need to work out any before the game?” suggested
Bill, maliciously.</p>

<p>“I kind of guess it’s just the other way, Bill,”
laughed Lef.</p>

<p>“You mean he’s got cold feet, and won’t show up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
at all. Well, that would be a joke now. What d’ye
suppose they’d do in such a case, Lef?”</p>

<p>“Either the wounded hero would have to go in
and be slaughtered, or else they’d have to temporarily
lift my suspension, and let me toe the mark.”</p>

<p>“I reckon you’re fit, all right, Lef. I’ve been
ketchin’ you for a week, and I never thought you
had so many cute tricks in you. And speed, why
it’s there to burn. I hope they do let you have a
chance,” remarked Bill.</p>

<p>Lef uttered a grunt of disgust.</p>

<p>“It’s all off,” he said, with a shrug of his shoulders.</p>

<p>“What d’ye mean?” asked Bill.</p>

<p>“Look yonder at that wagon stopping on the road
by the gate. A feller’s jumped out, and he’s got
a baseball suit on, too. It’s that sneak Ralph, as
sure’s you’re born. I’m on to his curves, all right.
He just wants to keep the crowd in suspense, you
know, and then get the cheers when he shows up.
Bah! he makes me tired, that’s what.”</p>

<p>Lef judged others by himself. Under similar conditions
that was just what he would have done, for
applause was sweet in his ears.</p>

<p>When Ralph was seen running across the field
there was a rippling cheer that advanced into a positive
roar. The boy’s face flamed, for he was not accustomed
to being in the limelight. Still, he paid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
no attention to the shouts that greeted his coming,
but hastening over to where the boys were still practicing
he met Captain Seymour.</p>

<p>“Glad you’ve turned up, Ralph. The boys were
beginning to get a little worried about you, and
Frank just said he’d go in if necessary, though his
arm is in a bad way, and he might injure it for
keeps. We want him for the last game—if there is
going to be another,” said Roderic, looking closely
at the other, as if to make up his mind whether
Ralph had brought his nerve with him.</p>

<p>“The delay was entirely unavoidable. I had to
carry a little child half a mile. She had crushed
her hand. That is her father in the wagon with her,
on the way to the doctor’s. Hello! Frank! better
late than never. Send her in, Paul! How long can
I have to warm up, Captain?” said Ralph, as he
caught the ball, and began to return it, quietly at
first, but with increasing pressure as his muscles
responded to the demand made upon them.</p>

<p>“The umpire says that the time is almost up; but
on account of your coming late he will postpone
calling the game ten minutes. Now, do your prettiest,
Ralph. I hope you get that trick ball working
handily this afternoon,” returned the other, who
was plainly more or less nervous.</p>

<p>“I’m feeling in fine shape, Captain. If they knock
me hard it will be because I’m out of my class, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
expect,” was the confident rejoinder he received.</p>

<p>For fully ten minutes then the young pitcher was
the center of observation. Friends and foes alike
commented upon his style of delivery. When he
sent in an extra swift one a murmur of admiration
bubbled forth.</p>

<p>“I guess he’s the right sort,” called the sanguine
Columbia adherent.</p>

<p>“If only he don’t lose his head when those hard
hitters begin to reach his ball a little. They’ve sent
more than one horse to the stable to be blanketed,”
declared another, less confident.</p>

<p>Many secretly sighed because Frank Allen was
temporarily out of the game.</p>

<p>“Hope he’ll be all right by next Saturday, then.
We can afford to lose this game, boys. It’ll only
square things, and make it all the more interesting,”
cried still another skeptic.</p>

<p>“Give the boy a chance, will you?” demanded a
man near by; “you talk like he’s thrown this game
away already. I tell you he shows up well, and perhaps
some of you croakers will get a surprise yet!”</p>

<p>“That’s the talk; encourage the boy!” called another
spectator.</p>

<p>“He needs it all right,” jeered a Bellport rough;
“why, what our fellows will do to that kid will be a
shame. It’s like takin’ candy from the baby, that’s
what!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>And all these floating exclamations came to the
ears of Ralph as he stood there near the end of the
bleachers and continued to send them in to Paul. He
had his teeth set, and was, as far as outward appearances
went, as cool as a veteran.</p>

<p>Coach Willoughby, ready for the fray, gave him a
signal just then. It signified that there had been sufficient
practice, and that he was about to call the start
in another minute or two; so Ralph drew on his
sweater, not wishing to catch cold, for despite the hot
sun there was a cool breeze blowing.</p>

<p>Frank wanted to have a last brief talk with his
friend. He knew more about the peculiarities of the
Bellport team than Ralph possibly could, and was
able to tell him just how some of them could be
coaxed to strike at an impossible ball.</p>

<p>“Notice that their captain, Cuthbert Lee, is on his
old job to-day at second, in place of Hough. He’s a
hard hitter, Ralph, but from what I know of him I
think your teaser ball will fetch him. Only don’t
use it too often. And if he ever gets on a base keep
your eye on him. He’s the fastest runner they have,
and can steal bases to beat the band, while the pitcher
is winding up.”</p>

<p>“Glad you told me, Frank. After the game wait
up for me. I’ve got some grand news to tell you,”
observed the pitcher, getting up and discarding his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
sweater as the loud voice of the old Princeton player,
now serving as umpire, was heard saying:</p>

<p>“Play ball!”</p>

<p>Frank took one look at the sparkling eyes of his
friend.</p>

<p>“Tell me, is it about that thing?” he asked, eagerly,
and Ralph, turning as he started to walk off,
nodded his head in the affirmative.</p>

<p>“Bully! You just make up your mind you’re going
to win, Ralph. I seem to feel it in my bones you
are!” Frank said, confidently.</p>

<p>Ralph picked up the new ball which the umpire
had tossed into the box, and sent a few sizzling ones
to first base while the balance of the team hurried
to their places in the field.</p>

<p>The crowd had become strangely silent now.
Every eye was glued upon the new pitcher, and of
course anxiety made many a Columbia heart nervous,
for Ralph was as yet an untried quantity
against a regular team. Many had faith in him, or
professed to have, though secretly even his boldest
adherents found themselves wondering how he
would act if those Bellport fellows ever began to
bombard his curves as they had been known to do
to more than one phenomenon in the past.</p>

<p>The lineup of the Bellport team was just the same
as on the preceding Saturday, with the one exception
of second base. Here the familiar figure of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
Cuthbert Lee was to be seen, and his cheery words
gave confidence to his men.</p>

<p>The batting order of the visitors ran as follows:</p>

<div class="indentleft">
<p>Snodgrass—Right field.<br>
Lee—Second base.<br>
Banghardt—Center field.<br>
Smith, Jr.—Left field.<br>
Smith, Sr.—First base.<br>
Lacy—Shortstop.<br>
Bardwell—Third base.<br>
Clay—Catcher.<br>
Coddling—Pitcher.</p>
</div>

<p>As usual, Snodgrass could be depended upon to
work the pitcher for a free ticket to the initial sack,
if it was within the range of possibilities. He was
a good waiter, and a fine judge of balls.</p>

<p>“Put ’em over for this beanery waiter!”</p>

<p>“Make him hit her out, West!”</p>

<p>“Don’t forget you’ve got eight other fellows back
of you, boy!”</p>

<p>“Now, soak it to him, youngster. You know!”</p>

<p>Ralph suddenly shot the ball at the batter like a
flash. It passed straight over the plate as though it
cut the same in two equal parts.</p>

<p>“Strike—one!” shouted the umpire, even as Snodgrass
jumped back, pretending that he had to dodge,
though he grinned at the same time.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

<small>MAKING A GOOD START</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Through</span> the grandstand and over the field a
wave of enthusiasm went.</p>

<p>Ralph paid no attention to the various shouts that
greeted his first delivery. He tried to see how he
could work his wonderful “spit” ball next, and
while Snodgrass struck he never came within inches
of a hit.</p>

<p>Derisive cries began to be heard.</p>

<p>“Get Snodgrass his glasses!”</p>

<p>“Put him out to pasture; he’s outlived his usefulness!”</p>

<p>Trust the ingenuity of schoolboys to invent scores
of cries calculated to unnerve the batter. But Snodgrass
only grinned and waited, crouching there as
though ready to annihilate the next ball that came
along.</p>

<p>Ralph thought it policy to try a couple of outshoots,
and as the batter failed to strike they were
called balls. It was time now to take his measure
again, and Snodgrass knew what was coming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>“Three strikes—batter is out!” followed a wicked
sweep which the Bellport right fielder made at the
erratic “spit” ball that Ralph handed up.</p>

<p>Lee stood there calmly awaiting his turn. There
was something in his attitude to tell Ralph he had
more to fear from the captain of the rival team
than any other man on it.</p>

<p>Twice Lee struck at elusive balls. Then he managed
to connect with one and sent a screamer at
“Bones” Shadduck on third, which that worthy succeeded
in knocking down, though recovering the
ball just too late to catch the swift runner.</p>

<p>“Now we’re off!” howled the coach, as he came
running up to take his place near the man on first.</p>

<p>Hardly had he spoken than the ball came plunk
into the hands of Lanky, who had been expecting
such a thing. Lee had danced off, as was his usual
custom. He made a desperate plunge for the bag,
but Lanky got him.</p>

<p>“You’re out!” shouted the umpire, waving his
hand suggestively.</p>

<p>Such a whoop as went up! It seemed as though
the crowd had gone wild. Bellport supporters
looked each other in the face.</p>

<p>“What’s this we’ve struck?” said one, blankly.</p>

<p>“He caught Cuthbert napping, sure! I never
knew that to happen before!”</p>

<p>“He’s a wonder at throwing that ball to first.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
Guess we ain’t going to steal many sacks on that
kid to-day, you hear me?” exclaimed another.</p>

<p>“Oh! rats! you give me a pain! That was only
an accident. He couldn’t do it again in a year of
Sundays!” ejaculated one of the Bellport players
who was lounging near the bleachers.</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” laughed a Columbia graduate,
“but all the same he’s got you fellows guessing, and
you’ll cut your leads short at bases while he’s in the
box.”</p>

<p>Banghardt, after knocking three fouls, also
struck out. This record against such known heavy
hitters delighted the crowd. A rattling cheer and
much hand-clapping greeted the incoming of Ralph.
Of course he had to doff his cap, and smile; but at
the same time he did not appear to be excited.</p>

<p>The umpire was watching him curiously, for
Ralph had interested the veteran Princeton player
very much.</p>

<p>“I think he’s going to do himself proud to-day.
These fellows may win, but not through that boy
going up in the air. He knows how to master himself,”
was what he said to Frank Allen, as he took
a drink from the water bucket.</p>

<p>“I knew he had it in him; and I’m rather pleased
that an accident kept me out of the box to-day. It
may be the making of Ralph,” replied the other;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
and hearing such warm, generous words, the umpire
nodded his head in appreciation.</p>

<p>He had doubtless known so much shallow envy
among ball players that such an exhibition of pure
devotion to the interests of the school pleased him
greatly.</p>

<p>The lineup of Columbia had been altered somewhat,
on account of Ralph taking the place of Frank
as pitcher. This threw him last on the batting order.
Ben Allison, the regular right fielder, was fortunately
able to occupy that place, and consequently he faced
Coddling first.</p>

<p>By the way Coddling threw a few to his first
baseman it was evident that he had felt the defeat
of the previous Saturday keenly, and was there
with blood in his eye, determined to retrieve that
disaster.</p>

<p>“Look at that, will you? Ain’t he got speed to
burn to-day? I’m sorry for Columbia, boys,” called
a Bellport student, with the colors of his school on
his hat.</p>

<p>“Get out your wipers, boys. It’s sure going to be
a funeral!” mocked a boy who boasted of the famous
orange and purple.</p>

<p>“Let up, you fellows. He’s going to pitch one
now!” shouted a man near by; and again the interest
was centered upon the pitcher’s box.</p>

<p>Coddling wound up and shot one over. Allison<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
promptly struck, but his bat only whistled through
the air, for the excellent reason that the ball was
not within six inches of where he supposed it to be.</p>

<p>“Say, Mister Coddling is some at that sort of
thing, you see!” howled a delighted Bellport supporter,
jumping up and addressing the bleacher
crowd.</p>

<p>“Sit down!”</p>

<p>“Hire a hall and take a day off!”</p>

<p>“Watch him send another disappearing ball down
the line, boys!”</p>

<p>Coddling did. He had Allison guessing right
from the start. Perhaps that was because the right
fielder had not faced him as yet this season, and his
enforced layoff had rather weakened his batting eye,
for usually Ben was a reliable hitter.</p>

<p>When he struck for the third time, and the umpire
waved him away, Allison only grinned and
trotted back to the bench, shaking his head humorously.</p>

<p>“Bones” Shadduck took his place, and was immediately
greeted with a series of entreaties to accomplish
something.</p>

<p>“Hit her out, even if you are caught!” his admirers
yelled.</p>

<p>Shadduck made ready to do his best. One strike
was called, and as yet he apparently had not gauged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
the delivery of the wizard pitcher, who faced him
with that tantalizing smile on his face.</p>

<p>Then he bunted, and was off for first like a shot.
Coddling made a wild dash for the ball, which had
started to roll along the line toward the sack. It
looked as though it would go foul, and perhaps that
was what kept the agile pitcher from trying to
snatch it up. When he did, it was too late, for
Bones had galloped over first, and was safe.</p>

<p>Jack Comfort’s business was to sacrifice him down
along the line. He, too, bunted, and while easily
out himself, Bones had seen his signal, and got a
lovely start, so that he found himself squatting on
second.</p>

<p>“That’s the way to do it! Play the game! Now,
Lanky, you’re IT!”</p>

<p>Lanky managed to knock a grounder that landed
him on first, and Shadduck on third.</p>

<p>“Coddling, take a brace and put ’em over!”</p>

<p>Then stepped up Buster Billings. His appearance
always created a ripple of amusement, on account
of his ponderous calves. Buster only winked
knowingly at the yelling crowd and raised his bat,
waving it to and fro, cautiously.</p>

<p>“Why, the feller thinks he can bunt now. Say,
don’t you know there’s two out?”</p>

<p>“Let Buster alone. He knows his business, you’ll
see? That’s only his gentle way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>“And he can bat some, fellers, believe me!”</p>

<p>Buster heard this last remark.</p>

<p>“Thank you awfully for that kindness!” he remarked.</p>

<p>“One strike!” said the umpire.</p>

<p>“Hey, was that a baseball or a cannon ball that
whizzed past?” demanded Buster, pretending to be
greatly astonished when he heard the thud of the
horsehide sphere in Clay’s old mitt.</p>

<p>And then he smote the very next ball that came
spinning along, smote it with so much energy that
it sailed away toward center field, with Tony Banghardt
running like a wild broncho in the endeavor
to get under.</p>

<p>Of course Shadduck was away at once, since there
were already two out. Looking over his shoulder
as he bolted like a frightened deer, he saw Banghardt
make a gallant effort to spear the descending
ball with extended hand; but he lacked a few inches
of being in a position to accomplish this.</p>

<p>Bones came home and the batter managed to land
on second, whereas another player might have
reached third, while Lanky perched on third, unable
to get home. Still, the crowd forgave Buster
for his slow running and assured him he was all
right.</p>

<p>It would have made no difference at any rate, for
Tom Budd struck out, after he had knocked up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
four fouls and quite tired Buster with false starts.</p>

<p>One inning had been played. The score stood one
to nothing, in favor of Columbia.</p>

<p>“Good boy! Do it some more, West!”</p>

<p>Ralph went into the box for that second inning,
resolved to continue his cool methods, and not allow
anything to rattle him.</p>

<p>His first man he managed to get with considerable
effort. Smith, Jr., was possessed of a good batting
eye, and could not be easily fooled with fade-aways
and such. Still, he fell before that wonderful spit
ball that had such an erratic course, and the umpire
finally announced that the sizzling straight one that
burned over the plate was the signal for him to go
into retirement.</p>

<p>After that Smith, Sr., stood up to give an account
of himself. He never appeared without his usual
grin, and even the taunts of the crowd did not
change his expression an iota.</p>

<p>“Smash!”</p>

<p>That was Smith, Sr.’s bat connecting with the
ball.</p>

<p>“Run!” shrieked scores of voices, as the bleachers
arose to a man to see just where the ball had gone.</p>

<p>Allison was after it, and making rapid progress
over the stubby grass in left.</p>

<p>“He can get it—good old Ben is on the spot!”
yelled one well wisher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>“Will he—maybe, maybe not!” sang out Jack
Eastwick, mockingly.</p>

<p>Allison did his best to get there; but there was
too much steam to that hit, and it escaped him, while
Smith cantered home amid a salvo of frenzied
shouts.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

<small>NEARING THE END</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> game moved along slowly.</p>

<p>Seven full innings had been played, and the score
was still low. It had swung around until it stood
in favor of Bellport, four to three.</p>

<p>“It’s anybody’s game yet!” shouted several.</p>

<p>“Get into harness, boys! Put on another wrinkle
and win out! You can do it, Columbia!”</p>

<p>“Where’s Herman Hooker? Get that voice of
yours working just now. Give the boys encouragement.
That’s all they want to pull out! Start
her up, Herman!”</p>

<p>“Yes, tune up, Herman!”</p>

<p>And as Bellport came to bat for the beginning
of the ninth, with no change in the score as yet,
Herman marshalled his cohorts in the bleachers,
and with that strident voice of his to lead, began
to cheer in concert, bleat out the famous school
cry, and sing “Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean,”
the immense crowd joining in until the volume of
sound might have been heard a mile away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>“Careful, Ralph; this is a crisis!” Frank Allen
had said as his friend picked up his glove and
started toward the box.</p>

<p>Ralph looked perfectly cool. Indeed, many who
saw him, and knew that this was his first game in
big company, prophesied that he would turn out to
be the greatest pitcher Columbia had ever known,
given a little more experience.</p>

<p>He had just sent one over, and smiled to hear the
umpire instantly call a strike, when there arose a
medley of voices from the point just beyond the
termination of the bleachers.</p>

<p>Ralph had accepted the ball from his catcher, and
held it gripped in his hand as he took a step back
into his box. Naturally his attention was directed
toward the spot, where he saw a tremendous commotion
had started, with men and boys swarming
back.</p>

<p>“A fight! A fight!” was the first cry that passed
around to the grandstand, and hundreds immediately
stood up to see, their interest in the game for
the moment forgotten.</p>

<p>But they immediately discovered that it must be
something else that had caused this stampede, for the
runners appeared to be frightened. What could it
be? Frank shouted to Police Chief Hogg, and the
latter started on the run for the scene of disturbance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>Every man, woman and child was now standing
up and craning necks to find out the truth. They
saw people running, women showing symptoms of
terror, and even men trying to put space between
themselves and some mysterious danger.</p>

<p>Then a shout went up, for upon the field had
suddenly appeared a bull, showing symptoms of
anger, and evidently in a mood to launch himself
at the crowd, many of the ladies wearing gaily-colored
garments that appeared to arouse the fighting
spirit of the animal.</p>

<p>Some of the boys of Columbia recognized the bull
as one belonging to a farmer who owned the property
adjoining the athletic field on the right, and
back of the grandstand. A high fence shut off this
pasture, but perhaps some of the boards may have
fallen down. At any rate, there was the bull trotting
straight toward the diamond, with hundreds of
frantic people going into a panic.</p>

<p>“He wants to toss a few over! Give the bull a
chance!” shouted a funny fellow from the safety
of the grandstand; but had he been out there on the
field doubtless he would ere this have been taking
to his heels, like the majority of the alarmed spectators.</p>

<p>Frank immediately suspected that some thoughtless
scamp who loved a prank without counting the
cost may have coaxed the bull to the opening made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
in the fence, by waving a red handkerchief, and
then dodging when he had accomplished his purpose.</p>

<p>“Get bats, fellows; we’ve got to chase him back
to cover!” he shouted, suiting his action to his
words.</p>

<p>Other players also snatched up some of the war
clubs, and thus armed they bore down on the object
of their solicitude. Meanwhile the bull had trotted
straight for Ralph in the box. It looked as though
the animal meant to follow up the advice of the
joker in the grandstand, and ascertain whether he
could knock the pitcher out of the box.</p>

<p>Ralph stood his ground. Indeed, he hardly knew
what to do, such was the tremendous clamor all
around him.</p>

<p>“Soak him one, you!” howled a fellow who stood
on the top seat of the bleachers, and waved his arms.</p>

<p>It was so easy to tell another what to do just
then, especially when in an apparently safe place
himself.</p>

<p>“Yes, hit him in the eye, Ralph! Here’s your
chance to win your own game!”</p>

<p>“Shoo the bully old boy away! He’s interfering,
with our game!”</p>

<p>“It’s a set-up job of Columbia when they’re getting
licked, that’s what!”</p>

<p>Ralph heard everything that was said. At the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
same time he drew back his arm, with the intention
of delivering as swift a ball as he possibly could.
Of course, it could hardly be expected that such a
puny thing as a baseball would be sufficient to drive
the bull away; but it was all Ralph could do—and
he did it to the best of his ability.</p>

<p>“Straight to the bull’s-eye, Ralph!” came a last
shout, just as he let go; and somehow it gave the
boy more or less satisfaction to know that he had
indeed done as directed.</p>

<p>The hard ball struck the animal with tremendous
force on the side of the head, and, bounding off,
fell upon the diamond. Perhaps the blow astonished
the unwelcome visitor at the game. He
seemed to stop a few seconds as if trying to figure
just where the new assault had come from.</p>

<p>“At him, boys!” shouted Frank, enabled to come
up because of this little delay.</p>

<p>A dozen lads, Bellport players as well as those
of Columbia, had armed themselves with bats. They
were close at Frank’s heels when he started in to belabor
the bull on the flanks vigorously.</p>

<p>One assailant the big fellow might have attacked,
but the multitude cowed him. Possibly he was not
a very vicious animal after all. Be that as it might,
the boys surrounded him like a wall, and forced
him to trot off toward the broken fence. He was
last seen kicking up his heels as he went through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
the gap, and his bellow a few seconds afterward
announced that while he may have thought it prudent
to retreat before superior numbers, his spirit
was not crushed.</p>

<p>Frank, while the others returned toward the diamond,
winded a little from their efforts, took a look
at the fence as he was temporarily fixing up the
several boards that lay upon the ground.</p>

<p>“These were all right before the game started.
Either some fellows knocked them off to get in
without paying, or else it was a set-up job to give
trouble.”</p>

<p>This last idea made him instantly think of the
fellow most likely to engineer a miserable game like
this—Lef Seller. He remembered seeing the bully
over on the field at the end of the bleachers some
little time before, and several of his cronies with
him. Could he have possibly taken advantage of
every eye being riveted on the close game to play
this dangerous prank? Some one might have been
seriously injured by the coming of the bull.</p>

<p>“What’s this.”</p>

<p>Just before putting up the last plank Frank had
thrust his head through the opening to see what
had become of the baffled bull. His eye had fallen
on something red lying in the rank grass close to
the fence.</p>

<p>“It’s a red bandana handkerchief, and a new one,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
too, that has never even been in the wash. And
that was what they used to lure Mr. Bull in here.
Well, perhaps a fellow may think that a joke, but
if half a dozen women or children had been gored
he might have gone to prison for it.”</p>

<p>He looked at the gaudy thing again.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I may be able to find out who owns this.
Looks like it must have been bought this very day.
Anyhow, ‘finders keepers,’ and I’m in one stunning
red bandana blower,” and, laughing as he stowed
it away, he returned to see the continuation of
the close game.</p>

<p>Smith, Sr., was on deck, with his bat making
little circles as he waited for his chance to whack
the ball. He had a peculiar “crouch” that amused
the crowd; but as the elongated first baseman was
a natural hitter, much could be forgiven him. In
baseball a batting eye is like the mantle of charity,
since it covers a multitude of sins.</p>

<p>Smith, Sr., did hit it, too, though he should have
been an easy out, only that the ball took an unexpected
bounce just as Seymour had set himself to
gobble it, and shot over his head.</p>

<p>“Oh!” came in a groan from all over the field,
though every one who knew the game understood
it was none of the second baseman’s fault, since
he never even touched the ball.</p>

<p>Smith reached first, and made a grand bluff of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
galloping down toward second to draw the throw,
but without success.</p>

<p>Lacy was a shrewd one, and sacrificed himself
for the good of the cause, advancing his comrade
nicely to second. Bardwell tried the same thing,
but tapped the ball too hard. Consequently it went
quickly to Ralph, who snatched it up, hurled it like
a cannon ball to third, catching the runner; and
then it was shot across the diamond in time to just
double up the stout Bardwell as he jumped for the
first sack.</p>

<p>“Now, what do you think of that?” shrieked the
local boys in chorus, led by the “best yeller Columbia
ever had.”</p>

<p>“Never could do it again in a hundred years.
Bardwell stumbled, as he generally does. Luck was
against us!” answered one of the Bellport shouters,
promptly.</p>

<p>Bellport had finished their side of the game. Columbia
still had an inning to play, with one run to tie,
and two to win!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<small>AN UNFORTUNATE HIT</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Who’s</span> up?” demanded Paul Bird, as he tossed
his mask and chest protector aside, wiped his steaming
face, and picked up a bat.</p>

<p>“You are, and if ever you made a base hit get
one in now!” said Captain Seymour.</p>

<p>“Yes, everything depends on this inning. We
can do it if we try, fellows!” exclaimed Ben Allison,
also selecting his favorite piece of ash.</p>

<p>Once again the crowd settled down, though the
anxiety felt was plainly depicted on the faces all
around.</p>

<p>The noise had broken out again worse than ever.
Even the voice of the brazen-throated Princeton
man could not be heard, and he depended on signals
to announce whether it might be a ball or a strike.
Not one of those boys but whose nerves thrilled
with the intense strain. And it can easily be understood
how Coddling must have suffered as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
toed the slab once more to try and mow the Columbia
boys down, so as to prevent a run.</p>

<p>“You know how to do it, Coddling. Give them
some of your famous teasers, and see ’em break
their backs trying to connect!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Coddling, one, two, three for yours, now.
And start right in with this guy of a catcher!”</p>

<p>“What have you got on him, hey? Did he let
a ball pass him like your feller? He ain’t so hefty,
but he’s the stuff they make champions out of!”
declared a Columbia backer, a brawny blacksmith,
whose appearance alone was enough to inspire respect,
so that the Bellport man dared make no answer.</p>

<p>Paul waited. He did not want to appear too anxious.
He knew that the man who was hurling that
ball over was just as nervous as they make them, and
he hoped to profit by this. Still, he could not hold
off when he felt sure he saw a ball coming within
his reach.</p>

<p>Too late after he struck he learned that it was
one of Coddling’s shrewd outshoots, and that it
had jumped beyond his reach.</p>

<p>“Get a pole, sonny!” advised some one from the
crowd.</p>

<p>“He felt for it that time; now he’s going to take
some!” shouted another.</p>

<p>“Strike two!” came the voice of the umpire,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
though Paul had not tried to connect; and that was
one of Coddling’s equally clever inshoots which had
seemed as if about to miss the plate by a foot, yet
took a sudden turn and shot in.</p>

<p>If one were only a mind reader, Paul thought,
and could guess every time what the pitcher intended
to do, how easy it would all be.</p>

<p>Suddenly changing his hold upon his bat, Paul
thrust it out with the intention of bunting. He
managed to connect, and was off like a flash, though
doubtful as to his chances for reaching first, for
he felt that he had not made as neat a drop of the
ball as he had hoped.</p>

<p>Still, the ball player to be successful must try to
the utmost, no matter how discouraging the prospect,
always hoping that some little luck may turn
things his way—a dropped or fumbled ball has given
many a base that was not earned.</p>

<p>“Run, Paul! Harder and you’ll get there!”
shrieked Herman through his megaphone, and the
sound seemed to spur the catcher to even greater
exertions.</p>

<p>Runner and ball seemed to arrive at the same second.
Some shouted that he was out, and partisans
of Columbia cried that he was safe. The umpire
steadied his hand. That meant the runner had the
benefit of the doubt, and should remain where he
was on first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>Then Bedlam seemed to break out! Even though
every fan from Bellport knew deep down in his
heart that the decision was just, still he felt it incumbent
on him to howl at the umpire, and the
ancient word, “robber!” was heard right and left.</p>

<p>The old Princeton man only smiled, and turned
his attention to the game. Doubtless he chuckled
at hearing the old familiar outbursts to which he
had listened many a time himself, and perhaps joined
in shouting at the referee.</p>

<p>By degrees the excitement began to ooze out, as
attention became riveted on the next man at bat.
This was Ralph.</p>

<p>They had failed to rattle him while in the box,
but that did not prevent the Bellport legions from
indulging in a most astonishing din. Ralph never
noticed what was going on. His eye was on Coddling.
He wanted to guess what sort of a ball the
clever Bellport twirler meant to dish up to him.</p>

<p>“Watch that feller! He’s going to win the game
if you let him hit it!”</p>

<p>“Strike him out, Coddling. He’s dead easy!”</p>

<p>“Hey, Ralph, old boy, you know what I told you?
Nothing less than a three-bagger will do! Hear
me?” called one fellow, who did not even know the
batter to speak to; but on the ball field astonishing
familiarity becomes the rule.</p>

<p>Ralph had his teeth set hard. If it depended on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
him to win the game he meant that they should not
be disappointed. He watched Coddling eagerly, yet
with every muscle set for instantaneous work.</p>

<p>Whack!</p>

<p>“He done it! I told you so!”</p>

<p>Ralph was jumping for first, while Paul had run
down to second. The third baseman had knocked
the ball down, but had to chase it, so that Coddling
rushed over to cover third as in duty bound, in case
Paul attempted to come along.</p>

<p>But he went back to second, quite contented.
Columbia stock rose just about then; and Herman
again led his crowd whooping in concert:</p>

<p>“Ho! ho! ho! hi! hi! hi! <i>veni! vidi! vici!</i> Columbia!
Sis boom, ah!”</p>

<p>“Once more, fellows! You can do it! They’re
going to pieces! See ’em creeping in, expecting to
make a double play. Over the second base, and win
the game, Ben, and the pennant!”</p>

<p>Allison meant to do that same thing. He took
a firm grip on his bat, and settled in his box to strike.
Since that first time he had faced Coddling three
times, and on every occasion had connected with
the ball, though twice he went out, once at first and
again when trying to stretch a fine hit into a triple,
much to the disgust of his backers.</p>

<p>The noise died away as if by magic. Every one
was holding his or her breath, in the expectation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
giving vent to a whoop when Allison had either
done what he set out to do or passed out.</p>

<p>Seymour stepped out and whispered to the batter.</p>

<p>“He’s telling him to bunt!” cried a few, expecting
that this would be the program; and not realizing
that with the infield playing short it was next to
suicidal to attempt anything along this order, and
meant double play.</p>

<p>Both basemen were playing well off, because they
had nothing to fear. Excitement was keyed up to
top notch.</p>

<p>“Look out for Banghardt!” shrieked a coach; and
Paul found that the center fielder had crept in, so
that he came near being cut off from his bag.</p>

<p>Again Coddling wound up to pitch. Allison let
the sphere pass.</p>

<p>“One ball!”</p>

<p>The next time it came the batter smote it full
“on the nose” and the sound of the collision electrified
that entire assemblage like a shock from a gigantic
battery. But alack and alas! as sometimes
happens, while he drove the ball directly in the line
he had marked out, it chanced to be just a few feet
too low!</p>

<p>To the horror of the Columbia adherents it landed
full in the eager hands of the second baseman, who
held it fiercely for just a second, when he sent it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
with all his might to Bardwell on third, but not
before touching his own base.</p>

<p>Was it a triple? There was a wild upheaval on
the part of the entire mass of spectators. Paul had
thrown himself headlong for the bag, but that
swiftly-sent sphere was there just before him!</p>

<p>The umpire made a sweeping motion of his hand.
Paul was out, and consequently Bellport had won
the game by making a wonderfully clever triple in
the last inning!</p>

<p>Bedlam broke loose right then and there, and the
crowd surged over the field, whooping and howling
their various class yells. Herman led in a volcanic
cheer for the clever players who had managed that
remarkable play; and followed this with shouts for
both teams. Then songs were sung, and the boys
fraternized.</p>

<p>It had been a splendid exhibition of work on
both sides. No one need be ashamed of having lost
such a game as that, as Frank hastened to assure
Ralph, who was naturally feeling a little sore over
such a sudden downfall to his high hopes.</p>

<p>“The fortune of the game, old chap! Got to get
used to it. Why, just before Ben knocked into that
triple it looked as if we had ’em dead easy. Oh!
why couldn’t he have pulled off one of his favorite
little flies just over second! But what’s the use crying
over spilt milk? You did great work in the box!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
Every one is saying we picked up a prize when we
came across you, Ralph.”</p>

<p>By this time Ralph could himself smile a little.</p>

<p>“After all, I came out twice as well as I expected.
If you don’t think my work was the cause of the
defeat I ought to be satisfied. I thought that bull
coming on the field broke me up a little. But, then,
they didn’t make another run,” he said.</p>

<p>Frank threw an arm around his friend and walked
away with him. He wanted to get out of the crowd
so that they could talk. He had heard what Ralph
told Captain Seymour, and was naturally curious to
learn about the little adventure that had delayed the
arrival of the new pitcher.</p>

<p>Besides, there had been those thrilling words
spoken by Ralph in connection with something that
bore upon his own tangled fortunes. What could
have happened?</p>

<p>“Now, you know I’m just burning up with curiosity
to hear what’s been going on, Ralph. What
about this little child you carried home after she hurt
her hand; and how does that happen to have any
connection with your own matters?” he remarked,
when they found themselves removed to some degree
from the crowd that was swarming along the
road back to Columbia, some to take the trolley for
Bellport, others river conveyances for Clifford and
beyond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>Ralph turned a glowing face upon his friend.</p>

<p>“Oh! Frank, I can hardly believe it even now, it
seems so very strange! Just to think, because I
wouldn’t believe some fellows were trying to get
me in the bushes, where they could keep me from
showing up, I’m going to hear the truth about the
past, and who I really am!”</p>

<p>“Hurrah! that’s great news you’re telling me, and
I’m sure as glad as if I’d found another dad myself!”
exclaimed Frank.</p>

<small>WHAT UNCLE JIM KNEW</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Of course</span> you are, Frank! Don’t I know what
an interest you’ve taken in this affair?”</p>

<p>Ralph looked into the face of his friend as he
spoke, and there was sincere affection in his expression.</p>

<p>“But tell me what happened, for I’m just wild to
know, Ralph.”</p>

<p>The other had looked around several times while
they walked away from the field that had so lately
been the arena for that fiercely-fought battle of the
bats.</p>

<p>“There’s some one following us, Frank,” he said,
uneasily.</p>

<p>“Oh! come, you’re nervous after all this strain,
and imagining things. I guess it’s only some fellow
who happens to want to go the same way we do.”</p>

<p>But when Frank had turned his head, to the surprise
of his comrade he gave vent to an exclamation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>“Well, I declare if I don’t believe it is him!” he
ejaculated, and his face took on an expression of
pleasure.</p>

<p>“Who is it?” asked Ralph, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Why, who but my uncle Jim!” was the reply.</p>

<p>Ralph went a little white. Really things were
happening very rapidly, once they had taken a start.
He observed with deepest interest the big man who
was breathing hard as he managed to overtake them;
and Ralph took especial note of the fact that he
seemed to have a very genial face.</p>

<p>“Hello! there, Frank; I thought it was you; but
you boys walk so fast I had more or less trouble
in overtaking you, and as to getting through that
crowd to speak to you on the field, it was utterly
impossible! How are you, my boy?” and the big
man from New York held out his hand to his
nephew.</p>

<p>“Glad to see you, Uncle Jim. And it’s plain that
you are just as fond of baseball as ever. Sorry you
saw Columbia go down in defeat, though,” said
Frank.</p>

<p>“Oh! that comes to every club sooner or later;
and in this case it was one of those accidents that
can never be avoided. I saw the last few innings,
and that triple play took my breath away. I give
you my word that contest was the equal of any I’ve
seen this year among the big leagues. And isn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
this the game little pitcher who held them down so
well?” with a curious glance at Frank’s companion.</p>

<p>“Sure it is, and he would have won his game only
for that streak of tough luck. Uncle Jim, let me
introduce to you my friend, Ralph West!”</p>

<p>The lawyer started and looked closer than ever
at the second boy.</p>

<p>“Glad to meet you, Ralph. And, to tell the honest
truth, it was to see you that I’ve journeyed up here
just at a very busy time in my practice.”</p>

<p>He still kept his eyes fastened on the face of the
boy, which of course he could see had gone white.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to meet you, sir; and it’s mighty nice
for you to say such kind things about my work. I’m
green at it yet, but hope to do better after more practice,”
Ralph managed to say.</p>

<p>“No doubt of that, not a bit. You’ve got all the
earmarks of a ‘comer’ in that line. But, Ralph, I
wish I were bringing you better news than I am able
to. I’ve been convinced by my brother that it is only
right to tell what little I know in connection with
that money, regardless of my promise. I’m only
sorry I happen to know so little, that’s all. But it
may start you along the right road.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir. Every little must help. I’ve
been fortunate enough to-day to meet a man who
seems to know something about the mystery of my
life; and he’s promised to tell me all this very night.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
So that good luck seems to be swinging around my
way just now.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Ralph seems to have been able to have done
this man a great favor. As near as I can make out
he found a little child in the woods with her hand
crushed. She was crying bitterly. Ralph was on
his way by a roundabout route to the ball-grounds
when this happened; yet he carried that child a long
distance to her father. And it seems that the man
recognized Ralph, or on hearing his name, I don’t
know which, only that he promised to tell him something
to-night,” remarked Frank, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Fine! couldn’t be better all around,” said the lawyer,
enthusiastically. “I see that to have been of
any assistance I should have turned up earlier. But
I had some very important cases on the docket; and
was not quite sure that I ought to break my word
until I received an urgent letter from Frank’s father
here. I can tell you just what I know in a very few
words, if you want me to, Ralph?”</p>

<p>“I am wild to hear, sir, and was just wondering
how I could hold out several hours until night came
along. Please start right now, Judge Allen!” exclaimed
the boy.</p>

<p>“Well, I am a man of very few words, which you
will admit is singular in a member of the legal profession.
The facts in the case are these: Last summer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
there walked into my office a gentleman whose
card I have here with me.”</p>

<p>Ralph glanced at the bit of pasteboard, and was
strangely thrilled to read the name “Arnold Gregory
Musgrove.”</p>

<p>“Musgrove!” he repeated to himself several
times, as though it seemed to find a singular response
somewhere in the cells of his brain. Oh!
could it be possible that his name was the same as
that of the mysterious gentleman?</p>

<p>The keen-eyed lawyer knew instinctively what
must be passing in his young mind, for he shook his
head seriously.</p>

<p>“It may be just possible, Ralph, but until you
hear what this other party has to say I wouldn’t
build up too many hopes in that direction. What
I have to tell you will not put you in possession of
the positive facts. But to resume. This gentleman
first of all asked me if, in the line of my business,
I would undertake a little charitable work for him,
and I, of course, said I was there for any position of
trust connected with estates or otherwise; for you
know, Frank, that much of my income consists of
remuneration received from the care of property,
as I am what is called an estate lawyer.</p>

<p>“Well, he told me that he had had a dear friend
who had died in abject poverty years back, and left
a boy who had been taken to the poorhouse away up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
in the country. The truth had only come to him
of late, and he wanted to do something for that
lad, but secretly, so that his name might never be
known in connection with the matter.”</p>

<p>Ralph gripped the hand of Frank convulsively at
hearing this; but he did not utter one word, only
kept his glowing eyes fixed upon the lawyer’s sympathetic
face.</p>

<p>“Upon investigating he had found that the lad
had been taken into their home by a couple named
West, living in the village of Scardale. He also
seemed to know that the boy was keenly desirous
of securing an education, from which he was now
debarred by the lack of means of his supposed
parents.</p>

<p>“And so after binding me to secrecy he explained
his plan of action. I was to act as his intermediary,
sending a stated sum the first of every month, and
never letting a single hint fall as to whence it came.
Sitting there at my typewriter, Mr. Musgrove himself
wrote those few lines accompanying the first
remittance. And I have never seen him since that
day, though I learned he was in Europe traveling
with a widowed sister.”</p>

<p>Ralph sighed heavily.</p>

<p>“I wonder if it can be true? And if it is, why
shouldn’t he want to tell me just who my father and
father were? If I could only meet him face to face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
I would ask him that, and expect an answer,” he
said, slowly.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the lawyer, with a little laugh, “from
what I saw of this Musgrove I’m afraid you
wouldn’t meet with great success. I didn’t wholly
like his looks. There was something shifty in his
eye, although he was rather a handsome gentleman,
and evidently accustomed to the best in the land.”</p>

<p>Frank spoke up just then.</p>

<p>“I can guess that you’ve been considering the
whole strange affair since you got my letter, Uncle,
and have arrived at some sort of conclusion yourself.
Won’t you tell us what you suspect, please?”
he said, urgently.</p>

<p>“That’s a hard thing to put up to a lawyer, accustomed
to dealing only in stern facts, and eliminating
fiction from his figuring. But since meeting Ralph
here I’ve made up my mind to turn to his side of
the case. In fact, before coming up I wrote to the
address Mr. Musgrove left me, informing him that
I must throw up his affairs, since business was too
pressing. That leaves me free-handed; and I can
assist your young friend, Frank, without stultifying
myself.”</p>

<p>“I knew you would, Uncle Jim. And now tell
us what you think!” cried Frank.</p>

<p>“Just this: I have a suspicion that Mr. Arnold
Musgrove may have had a hand in some business in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
the past that would not bear inspection. In other
words, that he was responsible for that boy being left
at the door of the poorhouse! That is a bold assertion
to make, without positive proof, and I would
hardly like to stand sponsor for it in court; but I
am only telling you this in secret.”</p>

<p>“Yes, go on, please,” said Frank, throwing an
arm again around Ralph’s shoulders, for he knew
the other was trembling violently with emotion.</p>

<p>“And as the years rolled on he must have kept
informed about what happened, for he knew all
about how Ralph had been adopted by the Wests;
yes, even to his ambition for an education. I imagine
the man’s conscience has begun to reproach him
as he grows older; and that it has finally forced him
to do something to compensate in a small way for
his action!”</p>

<p>After the lawyer had ceased talking there was
silence for a full minute, broken finally by Frank,
saying:</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps he may know it all to-night. I’ve
got my suspicions already, but I’m not going to say
anything yet. But I tell you I won’t sleep a wink
to-night until I’ve heard what Ralph has to report.
By the way, did you ever find out what the name
of Mr. Musgrove’s widowed sister was?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I had that much curiosity. It is Mrs. John
Langworthy, and her husband was a very smart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
and wealthy lawyer years ago,” replied Uncle Jim,
with a knowing smile.</p>

<p>“H’m; Langworthy, eh?” and Frank looked meaningly
at Ralph, as he echoed the name.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br>

<small>TWICE A PRISONER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It was</span> a peculiar coincidence that the freshman
spread was to come off this same night that meant
so much to Ralph.</p>

<p>The sophomores had been wild to glean the particulars,
so that they might in some fashion manage
to break up the feast, either by kidnaping some of
the first-year students, get possession of the president
of the class, or else purloin the good things
that had been laid in for the spread.</p>

<p>Ralph had intended going, for it promised to be
great fun. This new turn to his own private affairs,
however, knocked the notion out of his head. Indeed,
he forgot about it entirely.</p>

<p>The minutes dragged terribly, and yet he knew
that he ought to wait a decent time to allow Sam
Smalling and his little family a chance to eat their
supper.</p>

<p>About a quarter to eight he could hold back no
longer. It was getting dark, but he had asked questions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
of Frank, and knew just where to find the
cottage in which the Smallings lived.</p>

<p>To reach it he must walk almost a mile around
the town; but that, he expected, would be a matter
of only ten or fifteen minutes at most.</p>

<p>So wrapped up was Ralph in his own affairs that
he never once thought of looking around him when
he stepped out of the gate and started off. Had
he done so he would have discovered several dusky
figures dogging his footsteps in a very suspicious
manner.</p>

<p>They kept just so far in his rear until the town
had been left behind, and the country was at hand.
Of course these were sophs bent upon keeping the
new favorite of the freshies from attending that
dinner, which was doubtless to be spread in some
isolated barn far beyond the confines of Columbia,
in order to lessen the chances of the second class
interrupting the feast.</p>

<p>Suddenly Ralph’s sober thoughts were interrupted.
He found himself pounced upon and borne
to the ground. In vain he struggled, for three
proved too much for even the athletic hero of that
afternoon game.</p>

<p>At first he was amazed at what was happening,
and thoughts of some rascals boldly playing the
part of highway robbers flitted through his mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>Then a face was thrust close to his, and a voice
said:</p>

<p>“Your goose is cooked, freshie. No fine spread
in yours this night. Instead, you will occupy a dungeon
until the midnight hour has struck. And if
our plans carry right we’ll have gobbled your class
grub long before then.”</p>

<p>Of course the truth flashed through Ralph’s mind
now. He knew that he had fallen into the clutches
of the watchful sophomores, eager to capture all
the leading lights of the lower class, and spoil the
long anticipated treat.</p>

<p>It was exasperating to say the least. Of course
none of them would believe him if he declared that
he had no idea of attending the dinner, and was
bent on private business of the utmost importance.</p>

<p>Just as he expected, when he started to speak of
this they only jeered him.</p>

<p>“Tell that to the marines, freshie. Don’t we know
that they expect to elect you the president of the class
to-night, in place of Rud Kipling, who went home
last week sick? Oh! no, you don’t get loose until
the clock strikes twelve, so save your breath. Tie
his hands, boys, and bring him along. I know a
cot beneath the hill, and there we’ll chuck him in to
ruminate, while we hike after that grub.”</p>

<p>They assisted him to his feet after his hands had
been rudely lashed. Through a woods they walked,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
whispering at times. Ralph was really angry at
this unexpected bit of hard luck. If the boys only
knew what it meant to him to have his liberty they
could not have the heart to hold him a prisoner in
this way.</p>

<p>Coming to an old cabin, once the home of charcoal
burners, but long deserted, they thrust him inside
and, closing the door, fastened it in some
manner.</p>

<p>When the mocking voices of the sophomores had
died away in the distance, and Ralph found himself
alone, he set about trying to effect his escape. Had
it been the dinner alone that was the inducement
he might have taken it philosophically, and simply
laughed at his predicament; but while he remained
there, precious minutes were passing, and the story
of his mysterious past waiting to be told.</p>

<p>He struggled with the cord they had wrapped
about his wrists. The sophs were far from being
experts in tying up a prisoner, so that there was a
chance for Ralph to work his hands free. Force
would not accomplish it, but by manipulating his
right hand he was presently able to draw it out of
the bonds.</p>

<p>There remained only the door between him and
liberty. He examined this part of the structure, to
find, as he suspected, that it was just as flimsy as
the rest of the old cabin. Consequently, when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
threw his weight against it, after several attempts,
the door gave way with a crash.</p>

<p>Striking a light, Ralph found that all this had only
taken just fifteen minutes. It was now eight o’clock
plus seven minutes; and he was free to go his way.</p>

<p>Another thought came into his mind. Loyalty
to his class struggled with this wild desire on his
part to hasten to the home of Sam Smalling, so as
to hear all he had to say.</p>

<p>Was he not in duty bound to warn his fellows in
some manner? From what words the sophomores
who had captured him had let drop, it was evident
that they knew where the spread was to take place,
and that a raid was being organized, looking to the
stealing of the dainties provided for the freshman
dinner.</p>

<p>Ralph thought it over, even as he was hurrying
along. After all, it seemed up to him to do something
to save his class the mortification of being
made the laughing stock of the vindictive second-year
boys, who were evidently abroad in force, bent
on breaking up the spread.</p>

<p>Now that he came to consider the matter, the place
of secret meeting was in the same direction. No
wonder his captors were positive that he had been
heading for the rendezvous when overtaken with
disaster.</p>

<p>“I might go out of my way enough to meet some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
of the boys, and put them on their guard,” he said,
finally.</p>

<p>That was Ralph’s nature all over, ever ready to
sacrifice his own interests in order to benefit those
with whom he was associated. It was the spirit
instilled in the souls of the Delta Pi members—loyalty
first of all to the school, and next to one’s
class.</p>

<p>So Ralph made his way along cautiously. He
was in mortal fear lest he be pounced upon at any
moment by others of the prowling sophs, and held
once more a prisoner.</p>

<p>In this fashion he drew near the farm where stood
the barn hired for the occasion by the freshmen.
No doubt it was completely surrounded by a cordon
of eager sophs, anxious to accomplish their work of
retaliation, for the freshmen had effectually broken
up their entertainment earlier in the season.</p>

<p>Hearing voices coming along the road, indicating
a large company of boys and girls, Ralph knew that
the main body of his fellow class members must
be approaching, having gathered in town somewhere,
since the girls refused to attend unless suitably protected.</p>

<p>Of course the sophomores would not dare attack
this group. Indeed, their plans covered a different
field entirely, since they contemplated making way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
with the provisions that were being carried to the
spread.</p>

<p>Ralph waited until they were exactly opposite.</p>

<p>“Watchman, what of the night?” he asked, suddenly
appearing among them.</p>

<p>Several of the freshmen, thinking that an attack
was about to be sprung on them, had started to
grapple with the single figure. The passwords
spoken by Ralph, however, reassured them.</p>

<p>“Don’t mention my name, anybody,” said Ralph,
in an impressive whisper; “for some of the sophomores
are hiding near by. They think I’m a prisoner
in the old hut of the charcoal burners in the
woods. I escaped and came here to tell you that
they know all about the place of meeting.”</p>

<p>“Then somebody leaked, that’s all,” grumbled one
of the boys, angrily.</p>

<p>“I suppose so. But they mean to get a chance
to steal your grub. Look out for them, fellows.
Keep a good watch out,” said Ralph, impressively.</p>

<p>“Hey! hold on, where are you going to?” demanded
one of the group as Ralph started to slip
away.</p>

<p>“Sorry, but I can’t be with you to-night, fellows.
Some mighty important business of a private character
chains me down,” explained the other.</p>

<p>“No, you don’t now. You’re needed at the spread
more than any other fellow; and we don’t mean to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
let you off this time. Private matters must wait
when the class of Umty Fourteen has the call.
Duty before pleasure, you know. Besides, you’re IT
to-night, and we just won’t get on without you.
Come on!”</p>

<p>Ralph thus found himself in another fix, and
could well exclaim to be delivered from his friends.
First the enemy had captured him and tried to keep
him a prisoner until midnight. And now the fellow
members of his class, having determined to elect
him president for the balance of the season, seemed
equally bent on preventing him from keeping his
appointment with Smalling.</p>

<p>He said nothing further, but walked along with
the crowd. All the while he was keeping his eyes
open in the hope of seeing a chance to drop out, and
giving his classmates the slip. He could not bear
the thought of postponing the interview with Sam
Smalling that might mean everything in the world
to him.</p>

<p>They had reached the barn before he found his
opportunity. A number of freshmen had come on
at dusk to guard the place, so that their enemies
might not take possession unawares, and shut them
out.</p>

<p>While the two divisions were fraternizing Ralph
saw his chance, and dodged aside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>“Here, where’s Ralph West gone to? We mustn’t
let him slip away,” said a voice.</p>

<p>“He was here a minute ago, but now he’s gone!”
cried Helen Allen, in a plaintive voice; and Ralph
felt doubly sorry that he was compelled to forego
a pleasant evening in the company of Frank’s sister.</p>

<p>Scurrying through the end of the barn, he reached
the open air.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br>

<small>RALPH HEARS SOMETHING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ralph</span> had become cautious by this time.</p>

<p>“Two narrow squeaks, and the third time may see
me held tight,” he said to himself, as he crouched
there, looking around.</p>

<p>He knew positively that the anxious sophomores
were hiding everywhere about, their eyes on the
barn where the freshmen had vanished, bearing their
dinner with them. How to creep away undetected
was a question for the lad to solve. He found
where the darkness lay most heavily, and laid out
his line of retreat accordingly.</p>

<p>He was just about to rise when he thought he
had crept far enough away, when he heard a fluttering
of the bushes near by.</p>

<p>“Are the birds all in the coop?” asked an unseen
crouching figure.</p>

<p>Ralph knew that he had been taken for one of the
second-year boys. His ready wit came to the front,
so that he instantly replied:</p>

<p>“Yes. And the captain wants you all to creep in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
closer. I’m rounding the gang up. Move along!”</p>

<p>He came near laughing aloud to see not one, but
three shadowy forms crawling off in the direction
of the barn, and leaving the path free for the escaping
freshman.</p>

<p>“Ta! ta! and many thanks!” whispered Ralph, as
he waved a hand after the last of these figures.</p>

<p>Then he started away, and it must be a pretty
clever sprinter who could overtake him now, once
he made a break. In several directions he heard
low voices calling, as though the hidden sophomores
wondered who it could be running along the road.
But there was no pursuit made, for which the already
weary Ralph felt glad.</p>

<p>He had gone through with a tremendous amount
of mental and physical strain that day, and had no
desire to continue with another series of adventures.</p>

<p>So he presently arrived in the near vicinity of the
cabin home of Sam Smalling.</p>

<p>“There’s a light in the window,” he muttered,
as he drew near; “and that looks as if he expected
me.”</p>

<p>Ralph was shivering, not with the cold, or even
because of his double adventure that night, but with
apprehension. He dreaded lest a disappointment
might await him. Perhaps, after all, the story
Smalling had to tell might not shed any particular
light on his history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>Another thing that had begun to give him anxiety.
He wondered whether he might not be the child of
that same Arnold Musgrove, and that from some
cause or other his father was ashamed to own him!</p>

<p>Bracing himself, he stepped up to the door of the
humble cabin.</p>

<p>Hardly had he knocked before the door was
opened.</p>

<p>“Glad to see you, Ralph. I began to think you
wasn’t going to turn up, it was getting so late,” said
the man, holding out his hand and drawing him inside.</p>

<p>“I was delayed on the way. Our class is giving
a spread to-night, and the sophs got hold of me,
making me a prisoner. I had some trouble breaking
away. Then I had to go and warn the fellows so
they might not be taken by surprise. But after all
it isn’t much after half-past eight, sir.”</p>

<p>Ralph while speaking was looking around.</p>

<p>“Surprised to see me alone here? Well, to tell
the truth I was ashamed to let the missus know what
a mean thing I done aways back, and I got her to
take all the kids and go over to stay with a neighbor
to-night. The woman’s sick, and my wife can
make herself useful there. I wanted a clear field,
because I’ve got something to say I’m mighty much
ashamed of,” said Smalling, slowly.</p>

<p>“Before you tell me anything I think I ought to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
let you know what’s happened to me since I met
you this afternoon.”</p>

<p>So saying, Ralph rapidly narrated what the New
York lawyer had told him. The man listened
eagerly, though his manner was rather moody.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said as Ralph finished, “it all seems
to agree with what I know, only I wasn’t so sure
about them names. The man called himself Andrew
Jackson when he hired me to help him out years
back. Money tempted me; and besides, at that time
I hadn’t met the woman that helped me get the
better of my drink habit. Mind, I ain’t makin’ excuses
for what I done. It was a low game, and I’ve
often thought about it since, wondering what had
come of the baby I helped kidnap!”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>Ralph could not keep back that one exclamation.
It seemed to him that he must either be dreaming,
or else deep in some romance. That these matters
were connected with his own life seemed bordering
on an absurdity.</p>

<p>“You must be about fourteen now, Ralph, I judge.
It was nigh that time back that I fell in with a gentleman
who seemed to have plenty of money, and
wanted some one to help him play a little game. As
I said, at that time I was drinking hard, and conscience
seldom bothered me; so I joined forces
with him, and together we did the business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>“He brought the baby to me in the night. It
was a boy about three months old, and even if he
had dressed it in ragged and dirty clothes, I knew
that it must have come from some family away up
in life. It had the looks of an aristocrat.</p>

<p>“I obeyed orders, and carried that kid far away
from New York. Up here in the country I left it
in charge of an old woman for a month. That was
to wait till all the hue and cry had died out, you see,
and was according to my orders. Then I took the
baby and left him at the poorhouse door!”</p>

<p>Again Ralph sighed. It seemed to him that he
was in a trance. Smalling had allowed his head to
fall forward upon his chest, as though he could
hardly bear to look into the eyes of the lad he had
injured so deeply.</p>

<p>“Oh! please go on! How did you know that I
was taken by the Wests, and called Ralph? Tell
me everything—I must know all, now!” pleaded
the boy, with his voice quivering.</p>

<p>Smalling looked up.</p>

<p>“I’m going to tell everything now, Ralph, because
I’m sorry I ever had a hand in this game. I can
see now what that scoundrel was after, and how
he used me as a tool. Even if I go to jail for it,
I’m going to tell the truth!”</p>

<p>He brought his fist down upon his knee as he
spoke in this manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>“Three years afterward I just chanced to be up
in these parts again for a little stay. To tell you
the ugly truth, I was hiding from the police at that
time. While here I remembered about that kid, and
asked a few cautious questions. In that way I
learned that the Wests had adopted you, and that
they called you Ralph. And when I heard that they
were a good family, and would treat you white, why,
I just kinder let the thing slip out of my mind, believing
that you’d be happy without ever knowing
that they wasn’t your real parents.</p>

<p>“I admit that more’n once I tried to find that gent.
Them times was when I was hard up and thought
I might threaten him into giving me some more coin.
But he seemed to have covered his tracks too well
for me. I reckon I hunted New York all over
thinking to see him, but it was no go. Now I suppose
it was because he kept on the other side of
the ocean most of the time.”</p>

<p>“Then you remember what he looked like, do
you?” asked Ralph, eagerly.</p>

<p>At this Sam Smalling chuckled.</p>

<p>“It’s better than that, my boy, far better. I’ve
got a picture of my benevolent employer, took in
the queerest way you ever heard of.”</p>

<p>He drew out an old pocketbook, and rummaging
through this found a small piece of cardboard which
he handed to the boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>Ralph uttered an exclamation of astonishment.</p>

<p>The photograph was weak, having either faded
from age, or else because of insufficient light at
the time of taking; but it was easy to distinguish
in one of the two figures a man who much resembled
Sam Smalling.</p>

<p>“Why, isn’t this you?” demanded Ralph.</p>

<p>“No other. And that chap standing there is Mr.
Andrew Jackson, as he called himself, which I believe
is the same as Mr. Arnold Musgrove,” replied
the man.</p>

<p>“But what is he handing you—that bundle?”
gasped the boy, suspecting the truth.</p>

<p>“That was <i>you</i>, Ralph, the poor little baby that
he wanted to have disappear! Yes, this picture was
taken at just the minute he gave you to me. You
wonder how that could ever happen, and I’ll tell
you. I was bunking at the time with a drunken
photographer, and he knew what I was going to do.
It was his suggestion that he try and get a picture
of the man of money. I remember we had a hazy
notion that it might help us to get money out of the
chap later on.”</p>

<p>“And he managed it, then?” asked Ralph, wondering;
for flashlights were hardly in use so far
back, and this picture showed no signs of having
been taken in that fashion.</p>

<p>“He did, though I don’t know how. The click<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
of the machine startled my employer, and he came
near dropping the baby; but I told him it was a window
creaking upstairs in the old building, and he
believed it. But after all the picture never did
either of us any good, for I never could find Mr.
Jackson again to ask a loan on the strength of it,”
and the man laughed disdainfully.</p>

<p>“But now the picture promises to come in valuable
to me. Oh! will you please let me have it to give
to Mr. Allen, who is going to carry my case out for
me?”</p>

<p>“Certain I will. And, Ralph, though it may cost
me dear I stand ready to testify to my part in this
here rascally game when the time comes. I give
you my word on that, lad, come what will,” said Sam
Smalling, resolutely.</p>

<p>Ralph squeezed his hand when he replied.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it may not be necessary at all. I promise
you that you will not be brought into the matter
if it can be helped; and Judge Allen will find a way,
with this picture to help out, I’m sure. Oh! I wonder
how that man could have been so cruel. And
do you really think that his sister, this widow, Mrs.
Langworthy, can be—<i>my mother</i>.”</p>

<p>“That’s what it seems like, and you can make up
your mind to it, money was at the bottom of his
game when he stole you and had me take you away.
Sounds like a story out of the books, but I guess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
people to-day ain’t a bit different from old times.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad I came here to-night; and, Mr. Smalling,
after what you’ve said and done don’t think
I’m going to hold it against you. I’m too happy
myself to want to make anybody suffer. And later
on I expect to drop in here to see you again, you
and little Mary,” said the boy, rising to go, for he
was now just as anxious to see and consult with
Judge Allen as he had been to reach Sam Smalling’s
home.</p>

<p>“I’ll expect you, Ralph. I’m glad this happened
as it did. It’s just Fate, that’s what! But the best
of luck go with you, lad; and remember to call on
me if there’s any hitch to the game. Good night,
Ralph, good night.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br>

<small>A PLAIN TALK WITH BILL KLEMM</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">There</span>, what do you think of it, Frank?”</p>

<p>Ralph sat back in a chair in his friend’s den, and
waited to hear the decision of the one in whose
opinion he had such faith.</p>

<p>“It seems as clear as print to me, and I’m tickled
nearly to death at the way things are turning out
It was mighty nice in you coming here to-night on
the way home, and relieving my anxiety,” said the
other, vigorously wringing the hand of his visitor.</p>

<p>“But I had a double motive. I hoped to see your
Uncle Jim, and now you tell me he’s away for the
night—gone with your father to see a sick friend
over the mountain, and won’t be back until morning.
But what do you make of all this strange story?”</p>

<p>“That pretended Mr. Andrew Jackson is, of
course, Arnold Musgrove. And you are the baby he
turned over to Sam Smalling years ago. This picture
is what will clinch matters, if he puts up any
denial. As to just who you are, I have strong suspicions,
I must say,” returned Frank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>Then he wrote something on paper and thrust it
before Ralph.</p>

<p>“How would you like to start out fresh under
that name, eh?”</p>

<p>“Jack Langworthy!” read Ralph, and then threw
himself suddenly forward so that his arms clasped
Frank around the neck.</p>

<p>Nature had given way. So long had he been
fighting to hold in his emotions that he could control
himself no longer.</p>

<p>“I know I’m a fool and a baby to do this, but it
just seemed as though something broke loose and
swamped me,” he said, finally, as he wiped the
moisture from his eyes, and tried to smile in Frank’s
face.</p>

<p>“I don’t blame you a bit. In fact, I think you’ve
done bully to hold in so long. And then the strain
of that game to-day was enough alone to knock the
props out from under any fellow. But cheer up,
Ralph! It’s going to be all right now, for the sky
has brightened, and I bet a cookey you find a loving
mother inside another month. Just think of it, will
you? Hurrah! But I say, it’ll take an everlasting
long time to learn to say Langworthy instead of
West; for it’s a big mouthful.”</p>

<p>Ralph felt better after that.</p>

<p>“I’ll be around to-morrow without fail to talk it
all over with your uncle. Please don’t let him know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
anything about it until I come. I’d like to be the
one to tell him the story, Frank.”</p>

<p>“I’m mum on that score. But I wonder if those
sophs succeeded in stealing the spread of the freshmen,
or were they kept out of the barn by main
force? You’ve got some husky chaps in your class
this year, and they could give a good account of
themselves in a scrap. But Helen will tell me later,”
laughed Frank, as his comrade started for the door.</p>

<p>Ralph was really quite exhausted, and knew that
he must get home and to bed. The tremendous strain
of that strenuous day was indeed telling on him.</p>

<p>It was well on to midnight before voices outside
announced that the freshmen had returned from the
country. Helen came in, her face aglow with excitement,
to tell what a tremendous scuffle had followed
the attempt of the sophomores to break in and
spoil the spread.</p>

<p>“But our boys put them out all right, Frank! Oh,
it was a tremendous time. Perhaps some of us girls
were in the scrimmage, too, for I know I found this
cap in my hand when it was all over,” and she laughingly
held up a boy’s headgear, decorated with the
ribbon of the second class, as well as the purple and
gold of Columbia.</p>

<p>And that was all Frank could coax her to tell.
He could look back to several similar experiences
in his own school life, and appreciate what it meant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
to these freshmen, for Frank was a junior now.</p>

<p>In the morning Frank sauntered around to a certain
modest house in town, where he greeted a young
fellow by the name of Gabe Brown. Gabe was in
the store which Frank’s father ran, known as the
department store of Columbia. Moreover, he had
charge of a certain counter in which Frank was
somewhat interested just then.</p>

<p>“Hello, Gabe!” he said, as the other looked surprised
at seeing the son of his employer look up on
Sunday morning, “just wanted to get a little information
from you. Here’s a new bandana handkerchief
I picked up yesterday. Some fellow dropped
it out at the baseball grounds, and I’d like to find
out who he is. Can you help me?”</p>

<p>Gabe took the article, and examined it.</p>

<p>“Came from our place, didn’t it?” continued
Frank, seeing his smile.</p>

<p>“It sure did, and I think I know whose it is,
Frank,” replied the salesman.</p>

<p>“How could you be sure? Lots of these are sold
every season.”</p>

<p>“Well, you notice that it’s just about new, and
never been washed, for the stiffening is in it
still. That shows it was bought recently, don’t it?”
asked Gabe.</p>

<p>“Sounds reasonable,” admitted Frank, for this
was just what he himself had in mind all along.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>“Well, we ran out of these a week back, and ordered
more. They got in Friday evening, and I
sold just one yesterday. They’re different in design
from our old ones, too. See the point?” said Gabe,
triumphantly.</p>

<p>“Sure. Who bought that one, now?”</p>

<p>“Mr. William Klemm, Jr.,” came the expected
response.</p>

<p>“Thanks; I thought so,” and Frank turned away,
leaving Gabe looking after him and muttering:</p>

<p>“I reckon something’s going to happen close to
Billy Klemm just about now.”</p>

<p>Frank saw the object of his solicitude on the street
in front of a vacant lot. Bill had slipped out to meet
one of his cronies on the sly, and perhaps puff a cigarette
in the cool of that Sunday morning.</p>

<p>“Morning, Bill. Lost something yesterday, didn’t
you?” and Frank held up the red bandana.</p>

<p>Bill started to put out his hand, and then drew
it cautiously back, as though he might have scented
a trap.</p>

<p>“Naw, ain’t got any bandany rag. Belongs to
some other fellow. What made you reckon I owned
it?” he said, suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Because Gabe Brown says he sold you this particular
one from a new lot that just came in, and
different from the old ones. You were in a hurry to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
jump yesterday, Bill, when that bull started for the
hole in the fence!”</p>

<p>Bill shut his teeth hard and looked as if about to
hotly deny that he knew anything about that matter.</p>

<p>“Better go slow, Bill, or I might be tempted to
step around and tell your dad a few things. Keep
going with Lef Seller, and you’ll bring up in the
lockup sooner or later. And, Bill, it’s a lucky thing
for you that no one was seriously hurt yesterday
when you let that savage beast in on the crowd. If
there had been, I’d see to it that you were made to
pay the piper.”</p>

<p>The awkward fellow looked frightened, and let
his head drop on his chest.</p>

<p>“’Twas only a joke,” he mumbled, “but some fellers
they never see anything funny.”</p>

<p>“Not when the joke endangers human life, and
there were lots of kids around in the ball-grounds.
Here, take the bandana, and stop pulling chestnuts
out of the fire for Lef Seller, just like the cat did for
the monkey.”</p>

<p>Bill finally accepted the handkerchief, and tried
to put a bold face on the matter, saying:</p>

<p>“Guess if anything, the old bull he’s got a right
to kick, ’cause he near had the life pounded out of
him with them bats. It’s white of you not to peep,
Frank. I reckon I’ll take your advice, and cut Lef
out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>But Frank was not deceived. He knew the kind
of fellow Bill was, and that there would be a very
small chance of reforming his ways.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Frank was musing to himself as he walked
away, “they say there was a certain old gentleman
with horns and cloven hoofs who, when he was sick,
sighed to be a saint; but when he got well was he?
Not any! And Bill Klemm only feels sorry when
he thinks he’s in for a licking at home, or in school.”</p>

<p>When Mr. Allen and Uncle Jim returned, Ralph
was on hand. He and the lawyer went “into executive
session,” as the latter laughingly said, and remained
in the library for a full hour.</p>

<p>“He’s going to fix it for me,” declared Ralph,
later on, as he and Frank walked down the road
together.</p>

<p>“Then he thought it a clear case, did he?” asked
his chum, eagerly.</p>

<p>“So much so that he says he will start across to
Italy in a week, after his big case is over with, and
see the lady himself,” replied Ralph, promptly.</p>

<p>“Bully for Uncle Jim! Didn’t I tell you he was
game. But what does he do that for, when he could
cable?”</p>

<p>“He’s a lawyer, and cautious. Besides, he says,
and it looks good to me, that a man who could steal
a baby away from his sister for the sake of gain,
wouldn’t be above opening her mail, or even reading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
a cablegram. It might put him on his guard, and
spoil things. And so he’s going himself. Oh,
Frank, that will be a long month to me!”</p>

<p>“But with such happiness coming you can stand
it. Think of the past, and how different things
look now. Ralph, old chap, I’m sure glad it’s happening
this way. Besides, it’ll give a fellow a chance
to repeat that name Langworthy a few times to myself,
so as to kind of get used to it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be too dead sure,” remarked Ralph. “You
know the old saying, there’s many a slip between
the cup and the lip. But I’m glad you say your
arm is getting on nicely, for you’ve just got to pitch
next Saturday, and pull old Columbia through to
glory.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br>

<small>WHEN CODDLING WEAKENED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Crash!</span></p>

<p>“Wow! Look at that ball go, will you?”</p>

<p>“And two men on bases! Here’s where we climb
all over poor old Columbia!”</p>

<p>“What’s the score now?”</p>

<p>“Seven to five, and this makes it——”</p>

<p>“Hold on, there; you’re counting your chickens
before they’re hatched. Did you notice that reliable
old Jack Comfort got under that screamer, and
tagged it? And if you look sharp enough, Bellport,
you’ll see two husky lads tearing back to try
and make their bases before the ball comes; but it’s
no go! There, Seymour has it on his man, and
watch him send the ball to Lanky! All out! Set
’em up in the other alley, boys!”</p>

<p>Such a frightful noise as followed this splendid
play on the part of the club that was coming up from
behind. What with Herman Hooker and his squad
of howlers, megaphone and all, together with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
thousand other brazen-throated shouters, it really
seemed as though the very earth trembled.</p>

<p>It was the ending of the seventh inning. The
game was being played in Bellport, since they had
been fortunate enough to win the toss. That was
the first sign of luck in their favor. Besides, everybody
knew that Frank Allen was still somewhat
handicapped by his accident, though he had the grit
to continue in the box as long as Captain Seymour
wished.</p>

<p>At one time the score had been seven to three, so
that as the game progressed it began to seem that
the Columbia High boys were climbing. They had
had their little juggle, in which every man nearly
did something foolish, and runs piled in; after which
they had settled down to serious business.</p>

<p>“They’re creeping up, boys, creeping up!” shouted
Herman, encouragingly.</p>

<p>“Sure they are, and if the game only lasts ten
hours more it looks like Columbia might come in
neck and neck with Bellport,” jeered one of the
mill workers.</p>

<p>Watkins Gould was about, and evidently making
wagers, although he did not dare show the color of
his money. There was more or less talk about finding
some means of keeping him out, since he had
been known to try and influence a player to do some
underhand work and throw a game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>The eighth inning began.</p>

<p>Seymour had been encouraging his men to make
a break and do some consecutive batting that would
count.</p>

<p>“We only need two runs to tie, three to win, fellows.
Somebody jump on first, and then the rest of
us get busy with our little bats!” he was saying, as
his men came hustling in from the field to the bench.</p>

<p>“Batter up!” called the umpire.</p>

<p>“That means me,” sang out Ben Allison, as he
stepped forward to the plate.</p>

<p>Coddling looked unusually savage. The fact of
the matter was he knew that these boys of Columbia
were rapidly getting on to his curves. The last
inning they had hit him freely, and seemed ready to
take up the good work again right now.</p>

<p>When that feeling pinches at the door of a pitcher’s
heart, he is going to hurt himself trying to excel.
Coddling’s one great mainstay had been his coolness
under any and all conditions; and when he allowed
himself to show signs of anger he not only injured
his chances, but gave encouragement to the enemy.</p>

<p>Ben could always hit the Bellport pitcher. If he
got on first there were other dangerous batters to
follow. Just then they looked like real giants to
Coddling; and yet at another time he had smiled disdainfully
at the same fellows, and with coolness
struck them out in succession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>Allison was a good waiter usually. To-day he
took toll of the very first ball that the Bellport
pitcher sent twisting on its way. When a team gets
in its stride, and is hitting with perfect confidence,
all balls seem to look alike to them, and it is next
to impossible to keep the sphere out of their reach.</p>

<p>“That’s the way, fellows! Here’s Ben waiting for
his ticket around the course. Bones, push him along,
will you?” shouted Herman Hooker through his
megaphone.</p>

<p>Just as if he were taking his orders from that
source, what did Shadduck do but lay down the most
beautiful little bunt imaginable, right along the line,
but keeping well within bounds.</p>

<p>“Go it, you heifer!” shouted the bleachers.</p>

<p>Bones never got to first, but there was a grin on
his freckled face as he turned aside and retraced his
steps, for he had landed his comrade on second,
and that was what he had been instructed by Captain
Seymour to do.</p>

<p>Then up stepped Jack Comfort. It looked as
though he meant to duplicate the performance of
Bones, for he made a stab at the first ball. But that
was only in the line of a trick with Jack. All the
while he was picking out just where he could swipe
the next ball that came along.</p>

<i>Columbia High on the Diamond</i><span class="gap">      <i>Page <a href="#Page_215">215</a>.</i></span></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As the bat and ball came together with a vicious
smash, there burst from the frantic crowd a howl
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>such as had never before been heard on those Bellport
grounds.</p>

<p>“Run, Jack, run! Go it, Ben, you slow-coach.
Hurry! the ball’s after you!”</p>

<p>Ben made a gallant slide for home, though there
was hardly any necessity for it. Still, he believed in
making sure; and the ball did plunk in the catcher’s
mitt even as his hand fell on the plate.</p>

<p>“One run!”</p>

<p>“A man on second, and only one out!”</p>

<p>“Keep it going, you tigers. You’ve got Coddling’s
measure all right. Put the Indian sign on
him! Give us another cheer, Herman!”</p>

<p>“All together, then, and with a whirl! Here you
go, now! Ho! ho! ho! hi! hi! hi! <i>veni! vidi! vici!</i>
Columbia! Siss! boom! ay!”</p>

<p>Herman and his cohort could not sit through such
excitement as this. They had left the bleachers and
were jumping up and down like a group of wild
Indians, waving their arms, dancing in a circle, and
shrieking until every mother’s son gave promise of
being as hoarse as a crow on the morrow.</p>

<p>If noise could coax Columbia to win this up-hill
game, there was certainly every inducement in the
world for them to accomplish that task.</p>

<p>Lanky Wallace to the bat. Lanky had not distinguished
himself overly much thus far during the
day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>“He’s due for a hit, fellows, mark me!” cried one
enthusiast, and Lanky heard, for he grinned and
nodded, as if he felt it in his bones.</p>

<p>Coddling was wabbling by now. He had weakened
in the great strain. Somehow he believed in
his soul that Lanky had it in for him, and actually
began to toss wide ones, having less fear of the next
two batters. But Lanky was indignant, and did not
mean to be cheated of his prey. If the mountain
refused to come to Mahomet, then Mahomet must
go to the mountain.</p>

<p>“Step out and take one, Lanky, old boy!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you dare let him pass you! He’s tricky,
all right, and he knows you can swat it! Oblige us,
Lanky, please!”</p>

<p>Lanky evidently could not find it in his heart to
refuse such pleading. And he “swatted it” so very
hard that Smith, Jr., had to run like a deer to keep
the long-legged first baseman from making a clean
sweep of the bases.</p>

<p>The score tied, and a man on third, with only one
out!</p>

<p>Imagine the racket that ensued. Men began to
shake hands with each other in their intense emotional
excitement, that is, men who owned to a
partiality for Columbia. As for the good people of
Bellport, they cheered in a faint way, feeling the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
strain, but not exactly liking the way things were
going against them.</p>

<p>“Now, Buster, <i>you</i> know! Pick out a good one,
and send it over the fence!”</p>

<p>Buster wanted to do just that. It would have
pleased him immensely to have been the one to bat
in the run needed to lead the score, and possibly win
the game.</p>

<p>But he was over anxious, or else Coddling got a
new grip on himself; for Buster ingloriously struck
out. A groan went up from the Columbia High partisans,
for they had been indulging in hopes that the
wonderful Coddling had gone to pieces.</p>

<p>Tom Budd stepped up to try his luck. He had
been responsible for one of the earlier runs in the
game, and there was hope that he could connect with
a twister, just as before.</p>

<p>When the smack of the bat announced that he had,
a shout started to break loose; but it instantly degenerated
into a groan, followed by whoops from
the Bellport adherents. For Tom Budd had knocked
up a soaring foul that dropped into the big mitt of
Clay, and was smothered there.</p>

<p>During their half of the eighth the Bellport boys
went out one, two, three.</p>

<p>So the ninth inning opened.</p>

<p>Once again the Columbias had a chance to distinguish
themselves. Seymour himself started<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
things moving this time with a hot one that stung
the hands of Herbert Lacy at short, so that he
fumbled it, and the runner just reached the bag in
time to be called safe, though it was a close call.</p>

<p>Paul Bird knew that it was his part of the play
to advance the runner a base. He waited carefully
while Coddling took his time and recovered his wind.
Then Paul tapped a bunt close to the plate. Clay, in
his eagerness to handle it, fought the ball. It was
just about two seconds, but he saw he had lost his
man at second, and had to hustle hard to get Paul
at first.</p>

<p>Was this inning to be a repetition of the last one?
everybody sat up and seemed to be holding their
breath in suspense. Everything depended on what
Frank Allen could do, when a hit might mean the
game.</p>

<p>Frank tried to calm his nerves as he stepped into
the batter’s position and gave a reassuring glance toward
the grandstand, where he knew full well a
pretty girl was waving her little flag, and praying
in her heart that he would win his own game with
the single hit that was needed at this critical point.</p>

<p>Coddling was winding up preparatory to throwing,
when Frank received a signal from Captain
Seymour at second that told him to wait. He knew
what that meant, and that the fleetfooted Columbia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
man was about to get enough of a lead to steal
third.</p>

<p>With Clay behind the bat, that was indeed a risky
thing to attempt; but no one was apparently expecting
such a move, and in that it stood a chance for
succeeding.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br>

<small>WINNING AN UP-HILL GAME</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Just</span> at that moment there was such a dreadful
clamor all over the field that hearing any note of
warning was utterly out of the question. The Columbia
cheer captain had started in again with his
corps, and what they did to rend the atmosphere with
their racket was wonderful.</p>

<p>Coddling knew from the hasty gesture of the
catcher that something was going on; but he had
wound up for a throw, and could not hold back without
a balk. The best he could do was to send it
in direct to Clay’s hands, in order to give the other
a fair chance to throw to third, so as to catch the
purloiner of sacks.</p>

<p>Of course, Frank made a wild sweep at the ball.
That was a part of the game, to help disconcert the
catcher. Clay stopped the ball successfully, but it
came at such an angle that he was not in exact position
to hurl the sphere to third.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>A second counts for considerable at times in baseball.
Seymour slid like a Western avalanche. His
extended fingers touched the base just as Bardwell
grabbed the spinning ball, and dropped to touch him.</p>

<p>The umpire extended both hands. That meant,
of course, the runner was safe, and a shriek went
up from that immense crowd.</p>

<p>Now Frank faced Coddling again. Only a nice
little base hit was needed to bring the runner home.
Would the Columbia pitcher be equal to the call,
or must trusty old Ben Allison be delegated to the
task?</p>

<p>Frank struck! The “smack” electrified every
heart in that great throng!</p>

<p>Far away out over the center field soared the ball,
and several thousand eyes followed its flight. Every
player knew that the thing had been done, although
there was Tony Banghardt chasing wildly to get
out far enough to hold the ball.</p>

<p>“He’ll get it! Not this time, Columbia! Tony’s
going to hold that balloon!” howled a half-crazy
Bellport backer, as he stretched his neck to watch.</p>

<p>“You’ve got another guess coming, old fellow.
What will the man on third be doing all that time
eh?” jeered a Columbia student.</p>

<p>Banghardt did get under. He made a magnificent
catch, and held the ball, even though he rolled over
twice in so doing. But Seymour had shot from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
third bag the very second the ball fell. He was
racing like a wild broncho for home as Tony rolled
about in the field. And by the time the Bellport
player managed to regain his feet to hold up the
ball, a run had crossed the plate for the visitors!</p>

<p>Again and again did Herman Hooker lead his
demonstrative band around. They howled, they
cheered, they shrieked; and those who had lost control
of their voices jumped up and down like dancing
dervishes.</p>

<p><i>Columbia was a run to the good!</i></p>

<p>Allison went out, shortstop to first. Then came
the Bellports to the bat, grim and determined, with
Lee first to the plate, and ready to smash the ball
over the fence. Frank felt his lame arm troubling
him, but he set his teeth hard. He must hold out
now to the end. This game meant everything to
Columbia High, and he was determined not to lose
it, if such a disaster could be avoided.</p>

<p>And every other man on the team felt just the
same way. When Lee did go after an outshoot, and
give it a frightful crack, the crowd uttered an involuntary
“oh!” and then followed it with a tumultuous
burst of cheering. It was that acrobatic
shortstop, Tom Budd, who became responsible for
this mad applause; for he had thrown himself to
one side, made a stab for the speedy passing ball,
turned a complete somersault, and upon landing on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
his feet shot the sphere at Lanky on first in plenty of
time to head off the runner.</p>

<p>Banghardt came next. The Bellports died hard,
and Tony might have followed up his brilliant catch
with a hard hit, only he was short of breath. Consequently
after knocking two wicked fouls, the umpire
decided that he had allowed another good one
to pass over the plate. So Tony was invited to
retire.</p>

<p>Smith, Jr., appeared as the last hope. Already
were the players beginning to put their bats away in
the bags, as though the game might be reckoned as
good as over. Frank never faltered a particle. This
man was just as dangerous as though a dozen came
after him. There must be no let-up in speed or
curves; for many a game apparently won has gone
the other way through over-confidence.</p>

<p>Three times did Smith sweep the air without
discovering until too late that he had bitten at deceivers.
Then a roar broke out that dwarfed all previous
noises!</p>

<p>The game belonged to Columbia High! It meant
that the coveted pennant of the Tri-School League
belonged to Columbia High for this season!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br>

<small>CONCLUSION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> night a crowd gathered in the big assembly
room of the Columbia High School to see Roderic
Seymour and his gallant boys receive the splendid
flag which the girls of Columbia High had purchased
to fly upon the staff at the athletic grounds whenever
a game of any sort was in progress.</p>

<p>Helen Allen had been chosen to make the presentation
address, because she was known to be the
best speaker among Columbia’s fair ones. And both
Paul Bird and Ralph West thought her the prettiest
girl in the wide world as, with rosy cheeks and
sparkling eyes, she told what pride the sisters of the
Columbia boys took in their sterling fight for the
baseball pennant.</p>

<p>If there was one disgruntled fellow in that big
hall it must have been Lef Seller, who had seen so
many of his schemes for getting even with his rival,
Frank Allen, go astray of late. He had come because
somehow he could not keep away; but during<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
the exercises, while everybody else seemed to be
filled with delight, Lef could only grit his teeth, and
mutter low threats to himself, still cherishing the
hope that the day would come when fortune might
once more shine upon him, to the confusion of his
enemies.</p>

<p>Although the school term was nearly ended that
seemed to be no reason for Columbia High losing
all interest in outdoor sports. There were other
days to come, and that not far distant, when these
sturdy lads of the banner high school would meet
again in friendly struggles with their student rivals
of Bellport and Clifford. Something of the nature
of these contests may be gleaned from the title of
the next volume in this series, to be called, “The
Boys of Columbia High on the River; or, The Boat
Race Plot That Failed.” It will be found crammed
full of the further doings of these wideawake lads, in
whose fortunes we have found ourselves so deeply
concerned.</p>

<p>While the yearly examinations were being conducted
as usual, Ralph found it exceedingly difficult
to concentrate his mind on his work. He knew that
Judge Allen had taken passage for Europe, in order
to follow up the mysterious travelers, who had last
been heard from in Italy.</p>

<p>So the school year closed in a blaze of glory.
Principal Parke declared they had never known a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
more successful season, and with the percentage so
high. The graduation exercises passed off without
a hitch; nor was the electric current cut off on this
occasion, as had happened once before, when mischief-makers
severed the wires, and lamps had to be
brought in so that Lanky Wallace could complete
his declamation.</p>

<p>Ralph was frequently in consultation with his
good friend Frank, while he waited to hear from
abroad.</p>

<p>“What would I do without you, Frank?” he said,
as they sat under the apple tree on that July morning
just a day or two before the Glorious Fourth.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’d manage to get on all right,” returned
the other, quickly. “Cheer up, old fellow. It’s
always darkest just before dawn. You’ll get a letter
any day now, and perhaps written by the one you are
longing to hear from most. Try and put it out of
your mind for a bit, and think of the great times
we expect to have on the river.”</p>

<p>“That’s always the way with you, Frank. You
manage to chase away the blues better than any
medicine made. I’m going to laugh, and try to forget
my troubles for a little while. Yes, the letter
is on the way now, I don’t doubt; but oh! how the
days drag along, waiting for news,” sighed Ralph.</p>

<p>“Here comes Helen. Now we’ll go inside and
have her give us some music that is bound to liven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
us up. I just feel like singing, and it will do you
good,” cried Frank.</p>

<p>Ralph was nothing loath. There was an attraction
about Frank’s charming sister that always appealed
to the homeless lad. So they were soon
gathered about the piano, and joining voices in such
old favorites as “Tenting To-night,” “I Know a
Bank,” “Upidee,” and many others.</p>

<p>“Now, let’s wind up with the ‘Red, White and
Blue,’” said Frank, when Ralph had declared he
must be going.</p>

<p>So, as on many a hard fought athletic field, the
familiar words of the grand old tune rolled out—always
a favorite with these students of the famous
high school bearing the same cherished name:</p>
